# Project Overview

GitHub Contributor Analytics Generator for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing GitHub repository contributions. Features include:

- Daily, weekly, and monthly reports on repository activity
- Contributor profile pages with metrics and visualizations
- Activity tracking for PRs, issues, and commits
- Scoring system for ranking contributors
- AI-powered activity summaries

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Data Processing: TypeScript pipeline with SQLite/Drizzle ORM
- Legacy Scripts: Python for data processing and AI summaries
- Automation: GitHub Actions for scheduled reports
