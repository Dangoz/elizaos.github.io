    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Create Leaderboard Queries",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the getLeaderboard query function into specific subtasks covering schema analysis, query implementation for different time periods, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires understanding the database schema, implementing SQL queries with Drizzle ORM, and handling different time period filters. The complexity is moderate as it involves joining tables and aggregating scores."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create Daily Summary Queries",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the getDailyMetrics query implementation into subtasks covering schema analysis, metric calculation logic, date filtering implementation, and testing with sample data.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it requires querying multiple tables, implementing date range filtering, and calculating various metrics. Reusing existing logic adds another layer of complexity in understanding the current implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create User Profile Queries",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the getUserProfile implementation into subtasks for each data section (basic user details, summaries, tag scores, recent PRs, overall stats), plus integration and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex query task as it requires fetching and structuring data from multiple tables to create a comprehensive user profile. It involves sorting, filtering, and potentially complex joins across different entity types."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Extract Common Query Helpers",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks for identifying common patterns across queries, implementing the buildDateRangeCondition helper, and creating additional helper functions with proper documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires analyzing the other query implementations first to identify common patterns. The complexity is moderate as it involves creating reusable, type-safe helpers that must work across different contexts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Update Leaderboard Page",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the leaderboard page update into subtasks covering the integration of getLeaderboard query, updating the UI components to use new data structure, and ensuring static generation works correctly.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward as it involves replacing existing data fetching with the new query. The complexity comes from ensuring the new data structure works with existing UI components and static generation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Update Daily Summary Page",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the daily summary page update into subtasks for implementing the new data fetching, updating generateStaticParams to work with database queries, and adjusting the navigation logic.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves more complex static generation with dynamic routes. The need to derive navigation dates and ensure proper static parameter generation increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Update User Profile Page",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the user profile page update into subtasks for integrating the getUserProfile query, updating the metadata generation, and ensuring the component properly renders the new data structure.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to the daily summary page update, this task involves dynamic routes with static generation. The complexity comes from handling the comprehensive user data structure returned by the query."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Update Component Props Types",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the component props update into subtasks for each major component (leaderboard, daily summary, user profile), focusing on type safety and compatibility with new data structures.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful analysis of component hierarchies and ensuring type safety throughout. The complexity is moderate as it involves understanding both the new query return types and the existing component structures."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Remove Obsolete JSON Fetching Code",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks for identifying all JSON fetching code, safely removing it with verification steps, and ensuring no references remain in the codebase.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively simple cleanup task, but requires attention to detail to ensure all obsolete code is removed without breaking functionality. The verification step is crucial."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "End-to-End Testing and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the testing and optimization task into subtasks covering end-to-end testing methodology, query performance profiling, database optimization (indexes), and documentation of improvements.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive testing of the entire application with the new data fetching approach. The performance profiling and optimization aspects add significant complexity, especially for the more complex queries."
