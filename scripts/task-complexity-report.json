    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Create TypeScript interfaces and schema definitions",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of creating TypeScript interfaces and database schema definitions into logical subtasks covering interface definition, schema creation, and validation/testing",
      "reasoning": "This task involves defining TypeScript interfaces and database schemas which has moderate complexity. It requires understanding of both TypeScript type system and database schema design, but is fairly self-contained. The interfaces and schemas are foundational for the system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement enhanced pattern matching system",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the pattern matching system implementation into subtasks covering the different pattern types (regex, glob, string), optimization strategies, and integration with the TagPattern interface",
      "reasoning": "Building a flexible pattern matching system with multiple matching strategies and optimization requirements is fairly complex. It requires handling different pattern types, implementing various matching options, and ensuring performance optimizations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop multi-source data extraction utilities",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the multi-source data extraction utilities into subtasks for each data source type (PRs, issues, comments, etc.), with additional subtasks for standardization, pagination handling, and rate limiting",
      "reasoning": "This task involves interacting with multiple external APIs, handling different data formats, pagination, and rate limiting. The complexity comes from the breadth of sources to extract from and the need to normalize diverse data structures."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create database migrations for new schema",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the database migration task into subtasks covering forward migrations, rollback capabilities, and testing/validation of the schema changes",
      "reasoning": "Database migrations are relatively straightforward, especially since the schema is already defined in Task 1. The complexity is moderate due to the need for both upgrade and downgrade paths and ensuring data integrity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement tag rule configuration parser",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tag rule configuration parser implementation into subtasks covering schema validation, parsing logic, backward compatibility, and helper functions",
      "reasoning": "Building a configuration parser with validation and backward compatibility has moderate complexity. It requires careful handling of different formats and robust error checking, but is primarily focused on a single responsibility."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop core scoring algorithm with multi-source matching",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the core scoring algorithm development into subtasks covering rule application logic, weighting mechanisms, multi-source integration, performance optimization, and testing with complex rule sets",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it integrates multiple components (pattern matching, data sources) and implements sophisticated scoring logic with weights, caps, and diminishing returns. It's the central algorithm of the system with many edge cases to handle."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement historical tag score tracking",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the historical tag score tracking implementation into subtasks covering storage mechanisms, retrieval functions, aggregation utilities, and data retention policies",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database operations and time-series data management. The complexity comes from implementing proper aggregation and retention policies while ensuring efficient storage and retrieval."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create label-based scoring integration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the label-based scoring integration into subtasks covering label extraction enhancements, scoring algorithm updates for labels, and special handling for label matching options",
      "reasoning": "This task extends existing functionality rather than creating entirely new systems. It has moderate complexity due to the need to integrate with both the data extraction and scoring components."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop time-series visualizations for tag progression",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the time-series visualization development into subtasks covering chart component creation, trend analysis implementation, filtering capabilities, and responsive design",
      "reasoning": "Creating effective data visualizations with trend analysis and interactive filtering has significant complexity. It requires both data processing skills and frontend development expertise to create responsive, interactive charts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate new scoring system into existing pipelines",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the integration task into subtasks covering refactoring existing pipelines, implementing backward compatibility, adding configuration options, updating API endpoints, and performance optimization",
      "reasoning": "Integration with existing systems is complex due to the need to maintain backward compatibility while introducing significant architectural changes. This task touches multiple components and requires careful coordination to avoid breaking existing functionality."
