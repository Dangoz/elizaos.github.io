Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.

Fixed parameter reassignment by introducing a new variable\r\n4. Simplified if-else structure by removing unnecessary else clause\r\nAll changes maintain the existing functionality while improving type safety and adhering to linter rules.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

The test suite will need to cover queue update callback functionality from the FAL API\n2. There will be a need to test different types of 3D model responses (various file formats and sizes)\n3.

Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review.

Enhancing gas price optimization logic\r\n2. Improving volume calculation for trades\r\n3. Adding better handling of competing bundles\r\n4. Implementing more sophisticated price impact calculations\r\n5. Implementing robust arbitrage execution flow:\r\n   - Added retry mechanism with configurable attempts\r\n   - Improved bundle submission logic with validation\r\n   - Added simulation before execution\r\n   - Implemented proper error handling and logging\r\n\r\nKey implementation details:\r\n- `executeArbitrageTrade`: Implements the core arbitrage execution logic\r\n  - Prepares trade calls for both buy and sell operations\r\n  - Calculates intermediate amounts\r\n  - Handles miner rewards\r\n  - Manages bundle creation and submission\r\n\r\n- `createBundle`: Handles bundle preparation\r\n  - Estimates gas with safety buffer\r\n  - Calculates optimal gas price\r\n  - Signs transactions\r\n  - Creates bundle entries\r\n\r\n- `submitBundleWithAdjustedGasPrice`: Manages bundle submission\r\n  - Monitors competing bundles\r\n  - Adjusts gas prices dynamically\r\n  - Implements submission window management\r\n  - Validates bundle gas requirements\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n- Optimizes existing arbitrage functionality\r\n- Enhances execution reliability\r\n- No breaking changes to the API or interface\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nReview the changes in `packages/plugin-arbitrage/src/core/Arbitrage.ts`, focusing on:\r\n1. The `calculateOptimalVolume` method\r\n2. The `adjustGasPriceForTransaction` method\r\n3. The `submitBundleWithAdjustedGasPrice` method\r\n4. The `executeArbitrageTrade` method\r\n5. The bundle creation and submission flow\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Test the arbitrage functionality with different market conditions\r\n- Verify gas price optimization works as expected\r\n- Check volume calculations are appropriate for market depth\r\n- Test retry mechanism with failed transactions\r\n- Verify bundle submission with different gas price scenarios\r\n- Test error handling and recovery",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

The first registered function will be called.\n\nStuff like this will go away completely:\n```\nexport const EmbeddingProvider = {\n    OpenAI: \"OpenAI\",\n    Ollama: \"Ollama\",\n    GaiaNet: \"GaiaNet\",\n    Heurist: \"Heurist\",\n    BGE: \"BGE\",\n} as const;\n```\n\nWe should make sure to call trimTokens inside each model provider to make sure the token length is right, so we don't need to pass model info back into the runtime.\n\nWe should add events for the generation as well, so we can hook in proofs or attestations or hashes or whatever a user might want to add.\n\nWe should add runtime tests for calls and events.\n\nFor local modelProvider, we should make ollama a plugin that operates separately and move the code that is currently in the llama service.\n\nchunkSize has been set by model settings, if hardcoding chunk size is bad then we may want to get a call('getModelContextLength') function\n\nWe've been calling image generation through plugin-node/src/services/image.ts -- this is a bad pattern anyways, but also we can migrate this code to runtime.call()",

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nI improved the result that we return when generating a meme - return a description of the meme, instead of some generated text. Also added exports for the handler function so we can use it in the clients.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nYou can find all the related code in `packages/plugin-imgflip`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Register at imgflip.com\r\n2. Set the `IMGFLIP_USERNAME` and `IMGFLIP_PASSWORD` environment variables in `.env`\r\n3. Add the plugin to an agent\r\n4.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.

For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.\n\n### References\n\n* [https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167)\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>jshttp/cookie (cookie)</summary>\n\n### [`v0.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/releases/tag/v0.7.0): 0.7.0\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0)\n\n-   perf: parse cookies ~10% faster ([#&#8203;144](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/issues/144) by [@&#8203;kurtextrem](https://redirect.github.com/kurtextrem) and [#&#8203;170](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/issues/170))\n    -   fix: narrow the validation of cookies to match RFC6265 ([#&#8203;167](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/issues/167) by [@&#8203;bewinsnw](https://redirect.github.com/bewinsnw))\n    -   fix: add `main` to `package.json` for rspack ([#&#8203;166](https://redirect.github.com/jshttp/cookie/issues/166) by [@&#8203;proudparrot2](https://redirect.github.com/proudparrot2))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
