In twitter client when i put gemini api key in character.json . this api key wont get used for text or tweet generations. it always falls back to one i provide in .env resulting api key exhaustion.\r\n2. twitter agent filters out all the relevant tweet on which she can reply or retweet and then she replies all of then in an instant which leads to rate limit and flags our account as spam.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. put modelProvider as \"google\" and put your GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY in secrets.\r\n2. put more TWITTER_TARGET_USERS so that it may gather more and more tweets to interact with.\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"XYZ AI Agent\",\r\n  \"clients\": [\r\n    \"twitter\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"modelProvider\": \"google\",\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"secrets\": {\r\n      \"GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY\":\"AIza...\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"username...\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"password...\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"xyz@gmail.com\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"@solana,@ai16zdao,...\"\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  ....\r\n}\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n1. This provided api in character.json should be used to generate tweets and text for this particular agent as i am running multiple agent simultaneously.\r\n2. after interacting with one tweet or mentions or any action there should be a enough pause to avoid rate limit, flag or ban.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![2025-01-04 17 51 21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac4446b6-7d52-48f6-824f-d01956cb4534)\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-04 at 5 47 54\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04b8afee-6b14-400f-b276-55af7e8efc5f\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

Further, such capability is ideally extendable by templating. \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR basically makes the original #391 work end to end. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n1. Add more meaningful logs to json parser.\r\n2. Fix the evaluator flow in #391 , making sure goals and knowledge can be generated and memorized. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis change enables template-based instructions for agents. FXN will iterate over it, and continue building agent-agent coordination on Eliza. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nOnly plugin-bootstrap is touched thus testable. Follow the steps below if needed. \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Update operators in packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts by pasting your user id. \r\n2. `pnpm build && pnpm start`\r\n3. `pnpm start:client `\r\n4. Chat with Eliza agent and look for logs in cmd, as exampled below. \r\n<img width=\"1432\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 6 12 53\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afb368bf-db85-4238-a139-a222b8dff202\" />\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.
