It adds the ability to:\r\n- Execute trades between assets (e.g., ETH to USDC).\r\n- Log trades and export trade details to a CSV file.\r\n- Dynamically initialize wallets and handle on-chain trading operations.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Feature**: Non-breaking change adding new functionality.\r\n- Adds Coinbase trading plugin to the project, enabling automated trading.\r\n- Updates dependencies and introduces new helper methods for wallet initialization.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [x] **Yes**: The trading functionality and wallet setup process need documentation.\r\n  - Added a section in the README on how to configure Coinbase API keys.\r\n- [ ] **No**: N/A\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin with the following files:\r\n1. `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins/trade.ts`: Contains the trading logic and integration.\r\n2. `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/utils.ts`: Handles wallet initialization.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Wallet Initialization**:\r\n   - Use the `initializeWallet` function to create a new wallet with the Coinbase API keys.\r\n   - Verify wallet details are correctly saved to the environment or character files.\r\n\r\n2. **Execute a Trade**:\r\n   - Trigger a trade using the `executeTradeAction` in the `tradePlugin`.\r\n   - Example: Swap 0.01 ETH for USDC on the \"base\" network.\r\n\r\n3. **Verify Trade Logging**:\r\n   - Check the `trades.csv` file for accurate logging of the executed trade.\r\n   - Validate fields like network, source asset, and target asset.\r\n\r\n4. **Negative Testing**:\r\n   - Attempt a trade with an invalid network or unsupported asset.\r\n   - Confirm appropriate error messages are displayed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n### Before:\r\nN/A (New feature).\r\n\r\n### After:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1160\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-28 at 7 21 20\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3640609b-273e-4953-8a9b-d22136f85007\">\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1xeUW9sbQ74DinzFrXjqps7o2wqFWRSNv/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n#### Successful Trade:\r\n```plaintext\r\nTrade executed successfully:\r\n- Network: base\r\n- Amount: 0.01\r\n- From: ETH\r\n- To: USDC\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Error Handling:\r\n```plaintext\r\nError: Invalid network. Supported networks are: base, sol, eth, arb, pol.\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes:\r\n\r\n- Ensure Coinbase API keys are correctly configured in the environment variables before deployment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Database Changes:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deployment Instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Add the following environment variables to `.env`:\r\n   ```\r\n   COINBASE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>\r\n   COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run `pnpm install` to update dependencies.\r\n\r\n3. Test all features in a staging environment before deploying to production.\r\n\r\n---\r\n",

Stop the agent, update the knowledge and restart the agent. Check db.sqlite and you will see that no new knowledge has been added.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI would expect the agent should be able to absorb new knowledge that is added to the character file on each startup.
