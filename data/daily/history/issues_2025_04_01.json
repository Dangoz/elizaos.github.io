    "body": "# ElizaOS Twitter Plugin: Redundant Tweet Interaction Checks\n\n## Description\nThe Twitter plugin is repeatedly checking the same tweets and mentions in a loop, even after they've been processed. This creates unnecessary API calls and log spam.\n\n## Current Behavior\nThe system continuously checks the same tweets over and over, as shown in the logs:\n\n```log\n[2025-03-31 16:21:29] LOG: Checking Twitter interactions\n[2025-03-31 16:21:30] LOG: Completed checking mentioned tweets:\n[2025-03-31 16:21:30] LOG: Already responded to tweet 1906195114227020237, skipping\n[2025-03-31 16:21:30] LOG: Already responded to tweet 1906195395497091521, skipping\n[2025-03-31 16:21:30] LOG: Already responded to tweet 1906209067460137240, skipping\n...\n[2025-03-31 16:21:59] LOG: Checking Twitter interactions\n[2025-03-31 16:22:00] LOG: Already responded to tweet 1906195114227020237, skipping\n[2025-03-31 16:22:00] LOG: Already responded to tweet 1906195395497091521, skipping\n[2025-03-31 16:22:00] LOG: Already responded to tweet 1906209067460137240, skipping\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n- The system should only check new interactions since the last check\n- Previously processed tweets should be filtered out before logging\n- The interaction check should maintain a cursor or timestamp of the last checked tweet\n\n## Impact\n1. Unnecessary Twitter API calls that could lead to rate limiting\n2. Excessive log entries making it difficult to debug actual issues\n3. Increased system load from repeated processing of the same data\n\n## Possible Solutions\n1. Implement a cursor-based pagination system to only fetch new tweets\n2. Store the last checked tweet ID and only process tweets newer than that\n3. Add a proper caching mechanism for processed tweets with TTL\n\n## Environment\n- ElizaOS Version: 1.0.0-beta.7\n- Bun install && bun run build && bun start\n\n## Related Issues\n- Previous issue about duplicate key errors in Twitter mentions #4115 ",
