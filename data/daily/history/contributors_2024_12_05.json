The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility. Transfers are not yet fully functional, as noted in [Issue #735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/735). This will be addressed in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup.

Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   SLACK_APP_ID=your_app_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\r\n   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret\r\n   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token\r\n   SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your_verification_token\r\n   SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=test_channel_id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run the basic example:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-example.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Test summarization:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-summarize.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Try attachment handling:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-attachment.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Verifying Integration\r\n1. Start a new conversation with the bot\r\n2. Test direct mentions and thread replies\r\n3. Try uploading files and requesting summaries\r\n4. Verify message handling in different channel types (DM, public, private)\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n- TypeScript-based implementation with full type safety\r\n- Event-driven architecture for message handling\r\n- Built-in error handling and logging\r\n- Configurable message deduplication\r\n- Extensible provider system for easy customization\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- Full setup guide in README.md\r\n- Example scripts with inline documentation\r\n- Type definitions for all public APIs\r\n- Environment configuration guide\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] TypeScript implementation with full type coverage\r\n- [x] Comprehensive example scripts\r\n- [x] Setup screenshots and documentation\r\n- [x] Error handling and logging\r\n- [x] Message deduplication system\r\n- [x] Thread awareness\r\n- [x] Attachment handling\r\n- [x] Environment validation\r\n- [x] Testing instructions",
