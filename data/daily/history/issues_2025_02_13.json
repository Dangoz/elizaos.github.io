Users need a way to:\n- Analyze token contracts for potential risks\n- Get real-time market data\n- Assess social sentiment\n- Receive automated risk scoring\n\n## Proposed Solution\nImplement `plugin-expuzi` to provide DeFi token analysis:\n\n### Core Features\n- Contract analysis via Sui Network integration\n- Market data fetching through CoinGecko\n- Risk scoring system (0-100)\n- Warning detection for suspicious patterns\n- Social sentiment tracking\n\n### Technical Implementation\n```typescript\n// Core components\n- TokenAuditor class\n- Risk calculation engine\n- Contract data fetcher\n- Market data integration\n- Social sentiment analyzer\n```\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n1. Using existing blockchain explorers\n2. Manual contract analysis\n3. Third-party audit services\n\n## Additional Context\n- Requires Sui Network access\n- Needs CoinGecko API integration\n- Should support multiple token standards\n- Must include comprehensive test coverage\n",
