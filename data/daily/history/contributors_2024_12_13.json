Use proper sequential numbering (1, 2)\r\n2. Replace \"eg.\" with \"Example:\" to match documentation style\r\n3. Use a more clear example number (9999)\r\n\r\nThe final format should look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\r\n    \r\n    1.

Example: 9999--add-test-for-bug-123]\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Keeping \"eg.\" but it's less formal than our documentation style\r\n2. Using different formatting like \"For example:\" or \"(example:)\" but \"Example:\" is cleaner\r\n4. Using a bullet point for the example, but numbered lists better show the relationship between the instruction and its example\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis change aligns with our documentation styleguide and makes the contribution guidelines more consistent and professional.
