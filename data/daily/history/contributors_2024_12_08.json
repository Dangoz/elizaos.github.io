We will clean up old usages separately.\r\n\r\n# Risks  \r\n**Low**  \r\n- Existing functionality will continue to work but will display a deprecation warning.  \r\n- No impact on downstream systems expected.  \r\n- Risk is isolated to developers relying on raw text-based JSON generation.\r\n\r\n# Background  \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?  \r\nThis PR deprecates the text-based way of generating JSON objects using LLMs and so folks use generatedObjectV2 with typesafe structured outputs. Method isn't removed yet it is deprecated.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?  \r\n- **Improvements**: Transitioning to a more robust way of handling JSON outputs.  \r\n- **Chore**: Deprecation of legacy behavior.  \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?  \r\nText-based generation of JSON using LLMs is prone to errors like missing brackets, invalid types, or inconsistent structures. Moving to a typesafe structured output guarantees that JSON complies with predefined schemas, improving both developer experience and system stability.  \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n- **My changes require a change to the project documentation.**  \r\n- Updated docs to:  \r\n  - Reflect new structured output implementation.  \r\n  - Mark text-based generation as deprecated.  \r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps   \r\nN/A just a rename\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment steps required. \r\n\r\n# Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard deployment process applies.  \r\n\r\n## Discord username  \r\n0x8664\r\n\r\n---  \r\n",

The build process fails when attempting to resolve the image generation plugin import in `defaultCharacter.ts`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- 1. Clone the eliza repository (v0.1.5-alpha.5)\r\n- 2. Import and add the `imageGenerationPlugin` to Eliza in `defaultCharacter.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\nimport { imageGenerationPlugin } from \"@elizaos/plugin-image-generation\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [imageGenerationPlugin],\r\n```\r\n- 3. Run `pnpm build` in the project root\r\n- 4. Build fails with error message indicating it cannot resolve \"@elizaos/plugin-image-generation\" in defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe build process should successfully compile all packages including @elizaos/eliza. The @elizaos/plugin-image-generation package should be properly resolved as it's listed in the workspace packages.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- Project version: v0.1.5-alpha.\r\n- Build tool: turbo 2.3.3\r\n- Package manager: pnpm\r\n- The package @elizaos/plugin-image-generation is listed in the workspace scope but fails to resolve during build\r\n- Error occurs in the ESM build step using tsup\r\n- File causing error: packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n**Exact error:**\r\n```sh\r\nUSER@MACHINE MINGW64
