    "body": "I began exploring the v2 version of Eliza and initially assumed that the plugins listed on the [[Showcase](https://eliza.how/packages)](https://eliza.how/packages) and [[Plugins](https://eliza.how/packages/plugins/0g)](https://eliza.how/packages/plugins/0g) pages of the beta docs site were already compatible with v2.\n\n<img width=\"1356\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38d58b99-ca0e-4ea6-81da-01ad709ebf50\" />\n\nAfter discussing this with the team, I discovered that currently, only plugins in the `/packages` directory of the `v2-develop` branch are fully compatible with v2. The plugins shown on the documentation website are still v1 and may or may not function correctly.\n\nTo avoid confusion for developers, I suggest either temporarily removing plugins that aren't yet v2-compatible from these pages or clearly marking them as v1-only until they are fully updated.",
