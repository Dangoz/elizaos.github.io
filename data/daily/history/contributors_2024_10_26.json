We are trying to build a multi-agent simulation, so this is the problem we are trying to solve. Right now we have a shouldRespond handler that determines if the bot should respond, using a cheap model. If so, we respond. It's working pretty well, and it follows our ethos that Elizas are \"real agents\" that strive to mimic human behavior.\r\n\r\nI think it's something more simple and technical, but according to the agents, every other agent should just be a user."
