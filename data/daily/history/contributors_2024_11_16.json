A more sophisticated system could be considered that:\r\n- Could support configurable posting patterns (uniform, normal, life-cycle based)\r\n- Could allow custom range settings\r\n- Could include rate limit handling\r\n- Could add more natural posting behaviors\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified interval generation stays within 90-180 minute range\r\n- Tested loop continuation\r\n\r\nThis provides a baseline that respects platform usage patterns.",
