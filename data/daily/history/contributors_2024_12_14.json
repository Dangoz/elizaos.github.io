This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* CLI Tool\r\nWe want a create-react-app like experience for creating new projects, and we want CLI handlers for adding and removing plugins, opening chat interface in browser, maybe even deploying like Cloudflare Wrangler to some of our deployment provider friends. Should also handle secrets management and character / agent / conversation management.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.",

Basic client functionality for fetching a timeline, fetching mentions, and creating a post or comment.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis client allows agents to post to Lens, a social graph that is permissionless and provides a more onchain environment for agents, with a variety of monetization options including collectable posts and open actions.\r\n\r\nThis client is similar to the latest Farcaster client and serves as a base for other devs to include more Lens functionality.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA few `.env` variables are needed \r\n- get an evm wallet private key\r\n- get a lens profile owned by the same wallet: https://onboarding.lens.xyz/mint\r\n- get ipfs api credentials: https://storj.dev/dcs/api/storj-ipfs-pinning\r\n\r\n```\r\n# client-lens\r\nEVM_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\nLENS_PROFILE_ID=\r\nSTORJ_API_USERNAME=\r\nSTORJ_API_PASSWORD=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `defaultCharacter.ts` - add the new client to the `clients` array\r\n```\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [],\r\n    clients: [Clients.LENS],\r\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.GROK,\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. set new `.env` variables\r\n2. add client to character file\r\n3. start the server\r\n4. agent fetches timeline to generate a new post, and fetches mentions to generate comments\r\n5. if agent creates a post, check it at `https://hey.xyz/u/{agentHandle}`\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n`imthatcarlos`\r\n",
