            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a pnpm monorepo using Nix's buildNpmPackage that includes git dependencies (specifically @discordjs/opus), the build fails due to git access restrictions in the Nix build environment. The current workarounds involve either modifying package.json or pre-fetching git dependencies, both of which are not ideal solutions for maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA built-in way to handle git dependencies in buildNpmPackage that:\r\n\r\n 1. Automatically fetches git dependencies using fetchgit during the build process\r\n 2. Maintains compatibility with pnpm workspaces and monorepo structure\r\n 3. Preserves the original package.json without requiring modifications\r\n 4. Works with trusted dependencies in pnpm\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Manually pre-fetching git dependencies and placing them in node_modules\r\n2. Modifying package.json to use published versions instead of git dependencies\r\n3. Using mkDerivation instead of buildNpmPackage to handle the build process manually\r\n4. Creating a custom derivation to handle git dependencies before the main build\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly affects projects using Discord.js and similar packages that rely on git dependencies for native modules. The current workarounds either break the development workflow or require maintaining separate package configurations for Nix builds.\r\nExample of a failing build: \r\n\r\n`ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH Cannot proceed with the frozen installation. The current \"overrides\" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile`\r\n",

[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) can be used to send ZKCRO directly to an address on Cronos zkEVM\r\n\r\nRun the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZKCRO to \" - e.g. \"send 1 ZKCRO to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n\r\nAssuming you had 1 ZKCRP to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Cronos zkEVM explorer (https://explorer.zkevm.cronos.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/elizaos and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",
