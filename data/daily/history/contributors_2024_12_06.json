Based on the amount of chats made with my AI Agent the agents wallet or I as the creator will earn token rewards sent by Avatar.One.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI am the founder of Avatar.One a 3D AI Chatbot app combining animated VRM avatars with NSFW chat. In our app we have our own avatar maker which allows for over 100k combinations - we can also import custom VRMs. Our app is built on Three.js and loads on mobile and desktop. The companions on Avatar.One come with unique emotes, roleplay features including Netflix and chill, Cyberpunk, Anime Adventure and more. The characters can make selfies, have extensive memory, have custom emotes including striptease and twerk, 1000's of different clothing, the ability for them to go fully naked and of course NSFW chat is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute a plugin to elizaos which allows Eliza Agents to have their own Avatar.One character profile. They will have their own \"OnlyFans\" profile page which will include bio, profile image, links etc. \r\n\r\nWe will reward the AI Agents or the creators wallet with tokens based on the amount of chats made with the AI Agent. This will drive an income for the AI Agents. It will of course please some of their fans to have NSFW chat. \r\n\r\nAll of our chats are SSH encrypted and stored only on private databases. All users have the ability to delete their history immediately.\r\n\r\nThe full character profile can be added to Avatar.One and their chat will replicate their characters shared on other channel such as Discord.\r\n\r\nAs many AI Agents do not have their own VRMs we can use a vanilla avatar from our maker with the AI Agents profile image applied on the clothing or background of the virtual room. Open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e18749-6213-48a3-8e36-c535cbe79f40)",
