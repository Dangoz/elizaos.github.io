Please describe.**\n\nYes, The current interaction with the chatbot is limited to a command-line interface, which might not be intuitive or accessible for non-technical users. This can make it challenging for a wider audience to use and engage with the project.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nImplement a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. The GUI would include:\n\n- [ ] A text field for user input.\n- [ ] A button to send messages to the chatbot.\n- [ ] A panel to display the chatbot's responses in a user-friendly way.\n\nThis enhancement would provide a more intuitive and visually appealing way for users to interact with the chatbot, improving the overall usability of the project.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nWeb-based Interface: Instead of a desktop GUI, a web-based interface could be created using frameworks like Flask or Django. However, this approach might require additional setup for users.\nImproved CLI Features: Enhance the command-line interface by adding colors or formatting for better readability, but it still might not appeal to non-technical users.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\n\n**Additional context**\n\nAdding a GUI would align the project with the broader AI ecosystem, where accessible and user-friendly interfaces are highly valued. This could also attract more contributors and users to the project. A potential mockup of the GUI layout could include a central chat area, a user input field, and a button for sending messages.\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\n\n",
