I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3. Monitor query performance with larger datasets to confirm improvements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Updated query logic to include `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` and optional `LIMIT` in the PostgreSQL adapter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nI will attach screenshots of:\r\n- Successful working run with Postgres and SQLite.\r\n- Successful linting results.\r\n\r\n### Using Postgres adapter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1054\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 13 52\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3606a21a-6933-402b-ae7d-d24ecb6a1263\" />\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 15 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b8a289-1cae-4a2f-9493-25cf79dc2d4b\" />\r\n\r\n### Using SQLite adapter\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 16 57\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7f49f4-9880-4d4a-9586-d9548fda7dd5\" />\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 18 52\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e04f844-ab14-44e3-a7f4-2601a853af46\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 28 45\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b35cad-c73a-46d0-b52c-5b1e05d87388\" />\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 29 47\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857b593f-f9e4-4774-a44a-358ea26155d8\" />\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nNavigate to the `plugin-mpl-bubblegum` directory. Currently supports transfers of cNFTs. New features will be added.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nEnable the `plugin-mpl-bubblegum` in the test agent and set the RPC URL and wallet private key in `.env`.\r\nFor unit tests, run pnpm test in the plugin-bubblegum directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
