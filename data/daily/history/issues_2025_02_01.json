    "body": "I am not sure, but I think eliza has done something to the fetch method! Below I explain why!\n\nI am trying to add the image upload feature to Twitter client. I have passed data as `agent-twitter-client` library accepts, but when I call it I get this error \n```\n {\"errors\":[{\"code\":38,\"message\":\"media parameter is missing.\"}]}\n```\n\nI did extensive debugging. I cloned the `agent-twitter-client` and loaded it as a local dependency in eliza package.json.\n```\n        \"agent-twitter-client\": \"file:/Users/amin/Downloads/agent-twitter-client\",\n```\nI put some log at upload points in the `agent-twitter-client` and executed its tests that include image uploading. \nI could upload images by running this repo tests. But when I try to use it through eliza, I got the aforementioned error.\n\nIt's the upload point in the `agent-twitter-client`\n\n```ts\n    console.log({\n      uploadUrl,\n      p: {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers,\n        body: form,\n      },\n    });\n\n    const response = await fetch(uploadUrl, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers,\n      body: form,\n    });\n```\n\nThe console.log output is the same for running `agent-twitter-client` test and eliza agent running.\n",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nThe plugin-coinmarketcap package is expected to require comprehensive test coverage to ensure reliability and maintainability. Currently, the package's functionality, particularly the getPrice action which interacts with the CoinMarketCap API, should be thoroughly tested to prevent potential issues in production. Without proper test coverage, bugs and edge cases might go undetected, potentially leading to service disruptions or incorrect price data being returned to users.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA comprehensive test suite should be implemented for the plugin-coinmarketcap package. This is expected to include:\n1. Unit tests for the getPrice action that should cover:\n    * Input validation for cryptocurrency symbols and currencies\n    * Proper handling of API responses\n    * Error cases (invalid symbols, currencies, API errors)\n    * Rate limiting scenarios\n2. Service layer tests that should verify:\n    * Correct API endpoint configuration\n    * Response data formatting\n    * Error handling and propagation\n    * Edge cases in the API interaction\n3. Test infrastructure that should be set up with:\n    * Proper mocking of external dependencies\n    * Test environment configuration\n    * Consistent error handling patterns\nThe implementation is expected to use Vitest as the testing framework, with proper mocking of the CoinMarketCap API to avoid actual API calls during testing. All error scenarios should be properly tested to ensure robust error handling throughout the plugin.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\n\n**Additional context**\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n",
