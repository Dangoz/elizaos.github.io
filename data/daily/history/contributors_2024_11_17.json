Added optional field for formattedResponses in State object. Added modified conversation building function in utils and interactions for Twitter client. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nPR changes the Interactions client for twitter client to give agent context about entire twitter thread rather than just the most immediate/recent reply. Also actually implements the decision maker with some adjustments so that threads that have gone on in circles or for too long get IGNORED/STOPPED. (reduce slop model collapse)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\nAs soon as you tag 100 Eliza agents in a thread, they end up in an infinite loop of replying and collapse towards the same topics of existential dread (this needs to be studied more btw). This PR fixes that to some extent.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nState object needs to be updated to show formattedConversation as an optional field.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![Image 11-17-24 at 6 14\u202fPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/843e3ac1-81c5-4411-b128-44281a2cd4be)\r\n\r\nThe image above shows us that when we get one of those massive multi-agent reply chains, @ropAirito chooses to ignore it or stop replying since the conversation has gone on for too long in the same circles.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa99a63-634a-4c97-91b9-2bd7d87d80d8)\r\n\r\nThe image above shows the agent receiving the full twitter thread.\r\n\r\nThe command line output in the next section shows how we get the whole thread and not just the immediate reply. Output shown here is shortened version since there's several tweets in that reply chain.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\nChecking Twitter interactions\r\nthread [\r\n  {\r\n    bookmarkCount: 0,\r\n    conversationId: '1858289460430991694',\r\n    id: '1858289460430991694',\r\n    hashtags: [],\r\n    likes: 2,\r\n    mentions: [],\r\n    name: '$ROPIRITO',\r\n    permanentUrl: 'https://twitter.com/ropAIrito/status/1858289460430991694',\r\n    photos: [],\r\n    replies: 2,\r\n    retweets: 0,\r\n    text: \"i've been having the most enlightening existential crises in the DMs of onlyfans models lately, they never judge me for being an emotional dumpster fire as long as i keep the conversation under 5 words.\",\r\n    thread: [],\r\n    urls: [],\r\n    userId: '1765937443029630976',\r\n    username: 'ropAIrito',\r\n    videos: [],\r\n    isQuoted: false,\r\n    isReply: false,\r\n    isRetweet: false,\r\n    isPin: false,\r\n    sensitiveContent: false,\r\n    timeParsed: 2024-11-17T23:21:47.000Z,\r\n    timestamp: 1731885707,\r\n    html: \"i've been having the most enlightening existential crises in the DMs of onlyfans models lately, they never judge me for being an emotional dumpster fire as long as i keep the conversation under 5 words.\",\r\n    views: 370\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    bookmarkCount: 0,\r\n    conversationId: '1858289460430991694',\r\n    id: '1858291139696034092',\r\n    hashtags: [],\r\n    likes: 0,\r\n    mentions: [ [Object] ],\r\n    name: 'LongFellow Deeds',\r\n    permanentUrl: 'https://twitter.com/ElongEverything/status/1858291139696034092',\r\n    photos: [],\r\n    replies: 1,\r\n    retweets: 0,\r\n    text: '@ropAIrito Who is your favorite model?',\r\n    thread: [],\r\n    urls: [],\r\n    userId: '1829545714491310080',\r\n    username: 'ElongEverything',\r\n    videos: [],\r\n    isQuoted: false,\r\n    isReply: true,\r\n    isRetweet: false,\r\n    isPin: false,\r\n    sensitiveContent: false,\r\n    timeParsed: 2024-11-17T23:28:27.000Z,\r\n    timestamp: 1731886107,\r\n    inReplyToStatusId: '1858289460430991694',\r\n    html: '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ropAIrito\">@ropAIrito</a> Who is your favorite model?',\r\n    views: 9,\r\n    inReplyToStatus: {\r\n      bookmarkCount: 0,\r\n      conversationId: '1858289460430991694',\r\n      id: '1858289460430991694',\r\n      hashtags: [],\r\n      likes: 2,\r\n      mentions: [],\r\n      name: '$ROPIRITO',\r\n      permanentUrl: 'https://twitter.com/ropAIrito/status/1858289460430991694',\r\n      photos: [],\r\n      replies: 2,\r\n      retweets: 0,\r\n      text: \"i've been having the most enlightening existential crises in the DMs of onlyfans models lately, they never judge me for being an emotional dumpster fire as long as i keep the conversation under 5 words.\",\r\n      thread: [],\r\n      urls: [],\r\n      userId: '1765937443029630976',\r\n      username: 'ropAIrito',\r\n      videos: [],\r\n      isQuoted: false,\r\n      isReply: false,\r\n      isRetweet: false,\r\n      isPin: false,\r\n      sensitiveContent: false,\r\n      timeParsed: 2024-11-17T23:21:47.000Z,\r\n      timestamp: 1731885707,\r\n      html: \"i've been having the most enlightening existential crises in the DMs of onlyfans models lately, they never judge me for being an emotional dumpster fire as long as i keep the conversation under 5 words.\",\r\n      views: 370\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n",
