There is a risk of potential issues if the frozen lock file is not respected, which could lead to inconsistent dependency versions across environments.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the installation commands across various files to ensure that the `pnpm install` command uses the `--frozen-lockfile` option. This prevents the lock file from being incorrectly updated during installations. Additionally, an explicit update script has been added to allow updates without the frozen lock file option. We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."

This behavior can cause unexpected issues when deploying or running the application, as the installed packages may not match the versions specified in the lock file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. Run the command `pnpm install` without the `--frozen-lockfile` option.\r\n3. Observe that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is updated with new versions of dependencies, even if they are not specified in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command should respect the `--frozen-lockfile` option, preventing any updates to the lock file. This ensures that the installed dependencies match the versions specified in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, maintaining consistency across different environments.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue was addressed in a recent commit that added the `--frozen-lockfile` option to various installation commands in the project, including in the GitHub workflows, Dockerfile, and scripts. The explicit update script was also introduced to allow updates without the frozen lock file option, ensuring that developers can manage dependencies more effectively without risking unintended changes to the lock file.",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, maintaining comprehensive JSDoc documentation across our TypeScript codebase is a manual and time-consuming process. This leads to inconsistent documentation coverage and puts an unnecessary burden on developers. We need an automated solution that can help generate and maintain JSDoc comments while ensuring high quality and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPropose a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\n1. Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n",
