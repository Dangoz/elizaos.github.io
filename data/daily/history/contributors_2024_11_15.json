Fix Bot Voice Singleton Issue**\r\nResolved an issue where the bot's voice functionality failed because the service instance was shared as a singleton across different services. Introduced a Map to ensure each service type has its own singleton instance. This guarantees only one instance of each subclass is created and reused.\r\n\r\n**2. Add shouldRespond Function**\r\nAdded a shouldRespond function for the bot's voice feature to control when the bot should respond to user voice inputs.\r\n\r\n**3. Refactor Transcription Process**\r\nRefactored the transcription process by adding a debounce function, ensuring voice messages are processed only when silence is detected.\r\n\r\n**4. Enable Bot to Respond to Text Messages in Voice Channels**\r\nUpdated the bot to handle text messages sent in voice channels.\r\n\r\n**5. Move Template Functions to templates.ts**\r\nRelocated template-related functions to a new templates.ts file for reusability in message.ts and voice.ts.\r\n\r\n**6. Add Optional DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID in .env**\r\nIntroduced a new constant, DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID, in the .env file to allow users to specify a voice channel the bot should join.\r\n\r\n**7. Implemented Audio Playback Interrupt Mechanism**\r\nAdd a sliding window buffer that monitors the audio volume while the agent is speaking. If the average volume of the user's audio exceeds the defined threshold, it indicates active speaking. When active speaking is detected, stop the agent's current audio playback to avoid overlap.",

(Also, there are `IVideoService` and `IBrowserService`, but I'm not sure if these are necessary for the bot.) Would you prefer that I implement separate methods and instance variables for each of these services, or would you prefer a different approach? Let me know how you'd like to proceed :)"

I just share @lalalune 's concern around multiple instances of service rather than a 1-> many from service -> agents. Happy to add more context, but will defer @lalalune as he has more context!"

Specifically:\r\n1. Adds HEURIST_API_KEY configuration\r\n2. Implements Heurist model provider integration\r\n3. Adds Heurist model configurations\r\n4. Updates API key handling logic to support Heurist provider\r\n5. Adds model settings configuration including temperature, tokens, and other parameters\r\n\r\nThe integration allows us to leverage Heurist's cost-effective infrastructure for accessing open source LLMs while maintaining our existing architecture patterns.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document:\r\n- New HEURIST_API_KEY configuration option (free API key can be applied [here](https://dev-api-form.heurist.ai/) )\r\n- Available Heurist models and their capabilities\r\n- Model configuration parameters\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the model configuration in packages/core/src/models.ts\r\n2. Check API key handling in .env.example\r\n3. Review the generateText implementation for Heurist in packages/core/src/generation.ts\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure HEURIST_API_KEY in environment\r\n2. Test text generation using configured model by `pnpm start`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nN/A - Backend API integration changes only\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n- Requires setting up HEURIST_API_KEY in production environment\r\n- No database changes required\r\n",

The error seems related to the `better-sqlite3` module not being compatible with my version of Node.js. The error message suggests a mismatch between the Node.js version and the compiled module version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Error Log**\r\n```bash\r\n(node:37509) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The punycode module is deprecated.

The error message indicates that the better-sqlite3 module was compiled with NODE_MODULE_VERSION 127, while my current Node.js version requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 131.\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\nTry rebuilding the module:\r\npnpm rebuild better-sqlite3\r\n\r\nReinstall the better-sqlite3 module:\r\npnpm uninstall better-sqlite3 && pnpm install better-sqlite3\r\n\r\nEnsure the version of Node.js being used matches the version the module was compiled for.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nI am using Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage different Node.js versions.\r\nThe project is running in a Linux environment, but my system is dual-booted with Windows. I am using a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nI expect the server to start successfully, but instead, the error prevents the agent from starting.\r\n\r\n",
