My top of json looks like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed4bac71-899e-4db4-a0dc-afa0dd999559)\n\n\nI've added `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to both json and .env, I have needed dependency installed which is currently on this version `@elizaos/client-telegram 0.25.6-alpha.1` and from Telegram side Bot is responding to /getMe\n\nIs there something that I've missed of requirements?",
