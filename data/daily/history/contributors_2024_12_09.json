            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nFor our use case at Phala Network, we are building a base template docker image for developers to deploy their agents to our TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Cloud. However, we want to make the loading of the character json file easier to add via a command line argument vs building a new docker image with the new character file. Our main pain point is we want the user journey for technical to non-technical users to be able to publish their character configuration file to a storage protocol like arweave, ipfs, aws, etc. and be able to load those character files in through a command argument. This will make our deploy service easier with a docker compose file that can list the file id location in an argument like `pnpm start --characterUrl=https://characterfile.url`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe developer journey would go as follows:\r\n- Generate a character JSON file through any means (keep this step unopinionated)\r\n- Publish the character file to a storage service. (Ex. Use Thirdweb to post and pin to IPFS https://972b74063c2cd00df1a4cf777bf37d0a.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeicod5xghpshbxmfb3sh2ccfbb5657dgvxthgwolb42srz4a5iadwm/)\r\n- Create a new CLI argument to the `pnpm start` command named `--characterUrl` that will take in the URL where the character file is hosted\r\n- When the agent is being initialized, `fetch` the character file from the URL and allow for the agent to go through the natural process of starting up the agent\r\n\r\nCode changes should be minimal and would not affect any core functionality so the risk is low.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatives were building a web app similar to vvaifu, but this would not be a good user experience for cloud deployments or a good strategy to compete with them since we are focused on different problems.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis will help bring more users to Eliza with better security and privacy guarantees by utilizing TEE for safe Eliza agent cloud deployments.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nExample deployment with a mock docker compose file in the TEE Cloud.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0bec2d0-aa0e-418c-bf88-67e37edf1a17)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a plugin that makes Eliza verifiable through the use of TEEs. The plugin leverages the [Marlin Oyster](https://docs.marlin.org/user-guides/oyster/) platform and [SDKs](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo). More concretely, it adds an action that lets Eliza respond with remote attestations when asked. It is expected to be followed up with additional PRs for other aspects as well.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIt's important for AI agents to be verifiable in Web3 so users can verify behaviors and responses of an agent they are interacting with. A performant way of accomplishing this is running the agent in a TEE and providing remote attestation infrastructure for verification by users. Additionally, TEEs provide privacy protections to users' interactions with agents.\r\n\r\nIt is similar in spirit to `plugin-tee` but targets the Marlin Oyster stack instead.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes. A section on the plugin has been added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe README of the plugin. It specifies the `.env` settings as well as how to run a mock attestation server for local testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Run the mock attestation server, simplest way is docker - `docker run --init --rm -p 1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mock`\r\n2. Set configs corresponding to the plugin, just `TEE_MARLIN=yes` should suffice.\r\n3. Chat with Eliza and ask for a remote attestation, I have tried various phrasings like \"attest yourself\", \"get me a remote attestation\", etc which seem to work.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`roshanroshan`",

Considered trying the cookies from a logged in browser, but it uses the x.com domain, and when you try to add those, startup complains about the wrong domain. Login works, posting works, it just seems that the cookies should work to not trigger new logins each time. Guessing at some point Twitter will flag continuous logins like this. If I don't add cookies at all, same thing, it works, but triggers a login alert email each time.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSimply starting Eliza with Twitter credentials added + manual cookies. They do get cached in the db, but on restart, it still doesn't consider itself logged in and I get an email.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nStay logged in. Don't trigger a new login email alert from Twitter.\r\n",
