New `validateVectorSetup` function:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   private async validateVectorSetup(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n       try {\r\n           const vectorExt = await this.query(`\r\n               SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n           `);\r\n           const hasVector = vectorExt.rows.length > 0;\r\n           \r\n           if (!hasVector) {\r\n               elizaLogger.error(\"Vector extension not found in database\");\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n           \r\n           return true;\r\n       } catch (error) {\r\n           elizaLogger.error(\"Failed to validate vector extension:\", {\r\n               error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)\r\n           });\r\n           return false;\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Enhanced `init()` method:\r\n   - Added vector validation during initialization\r\n   - Improved schema application logic\r\n   - Better error handling for vector operations\r\n   - Proper dimension validation (1536)\r\n\r\n## Testing Infrastructure\r\n\r\n### New Test Suite\r\nLocated in `src/__tests__/`:\r\n\r\n1. `vector-extension.test.ts`:\r\n   - Schema management tests\r\n   - Memory operations with vector tests\r\n   - Error handling and validation tests\r\n\r\n2. `docker-compose.test.yml`:\r\n   ```yaml\r\n   version: '3.8'\r\n   services:\r\n     postgres-test:\r\n       image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16\r\n       environment:\r\n         POSTGRES_DB: eliza_test\r\n         POSTGRES_USER: postgres\r\n         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\r\n       ports:\r\n         - \"5433:5432\"\r\n       healthcheck:\r\n         test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready\"]\r\n         interval: 10s\r\n         timeout: 5s\r\n         retries: 5\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. `run_tests.sh` - Automated test environment\r\n4. `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation\r\n\r\n## Test Results\r\n\r\n### Vector Extension Tests\r\n```\r\n\u2713 Schema and Extension Management (4/4)\r\n  \u2713 should initialize with vector extension\r\n  \u2713 should handle missing rooms table\r\n  \u2713 should not reapply schema when everything exists\r\n  \u2713 should handle transaction rollback on error\r\n\r\n\u2713 Memory Operations with Vector (3/3)\r\n  \u2713 should create and retrieve memory with vector embedding\r\n  \u2713 should search memories by embedding\r\n  \u2713 should handle invalid embedding dimensions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Environment Details\r\n- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector\r\n- Test database: eliza_test\r\n- Port: 5433 (isolated)\r\n- Vector dimensions: 1536 (OpenAI standard)\r\n\r\n## Key Improvements\r\n\r\n1. **Vector Validation**:\r\n   - Proper dimension verification (1536)\r\n   - Extension presence checks\r\n   - Clear error messages\r\n   - Robust validation logic\r\n\r\n2. **Testing Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Automated test environment\r\n   - Comprehensive test coverage\r\n   - Isolated testing setup\r\n   - Vector-specific test cases\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation**:\r\n   - Setup instructions\r\n   - Testing procedures\r\n   - Troubleshooting guide\r\n   - Vector operation examples\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Resolves #1687\r\n- Ensures correct vector dimensions\r\n- Prevents invalid vector operations\r\n- Provides comprehensive testing\r\n- Improves error handling and logging\r\n- Better developer experience with clear error messages\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 16+\r\n- pgvector extension\r\n- Docker for testing\r\n- Node.js and pnpm\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- Implementation validates vector dimensions properly\r\n- All tests passing successfully\r\n- Proper error handling for vector operations\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage for vector functionality\r\n- Clear error messages for debugging\r\n",

            "body": "# PR: Fix PostgreSQL Vector Extension Issues (#1561)\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe PostgreSQL adapter was encountering a \"type vector does not exist\" error when trying to create tables that use the `vector` type. This was happening because:\r\n1. The `vector` extension was being created in the `extensions` schema\r\n2. The `vector` type wasn't accessible in the `public` schema where tables were being created\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nWe implemented a robust fix that:\r\n1. Creates the `extensions` schema if it doesn't exist\r\n2. Properly handles the `vector` extension creation in the `extensions` schema\r\n3. Adds the `extensions` schema to the search path before table creation\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n```sql\r\n-- Create extensions schema first\r\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;\r\n\r\nDO $$\r\nBEGIN\r\n    IF NOT EXISTS (\r\n        SELECT 1\r\n        FROM pg_extension\r\n        WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n    ) THEN\r\n        CREATE EXTENSION vector\r\n        SCHEMA extensions;\r\n    END IF;\r\nEND $$;\r\n\r\n-- Add extensions schema to search path\r\nSET search_path TO public, extensions;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing and Verification\r\n### Test Environment\r\n- Docker container using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image\r\n- Clean PostgreSQL instance with pgvector support\r\n- Database: `eliza_test`\r\n\r\n### Test Scenarios\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Installation Test**\r\n   - \u2705 Schema creation successful\r\n   - \u2705 Vector extension created without errors\r\n   - \u2705 All tables created with correct vector type\r\n   - \u2705 All indexes created successfully\r\n   - \u2705 Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n2. **Idempotency Test (Second Run)**\r\n   - \u2705 No duplicate key errors\r\n   - \u2705 Proper handling of existing objects with NOTICE messages\r\n   - \u2705 Vector extension checks working correctly\r\n   - \u2705 Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n### Test Results\r\n```sql\r\n-- First Run Output\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\nCREATE EXTENSION\r\nSET\r\n[... tables and indexes created successfully ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n\r\n-- Second Run Output\r\nNOTICE: schema \"extensions\" already exists, skipping\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\n[... proper \"already exists\" notices ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nThis fix:\r\n- Resolves issue #1561\r\n- Prevents duplicate extension creation errors\r\n- Maintains proper schema organization\r\n- Ensures vector operations work correctly across schemas\r\n- Provides idempotent schema creation\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- The solution follows PostgreSQL best practices for extension management\r\n- Schema search path is explicitly set to ensure type availability\r\n- Implementation is idempotent and safe to run multiple times\r\n- Tested with pgvector-enabled PostgreSQL instance\r\n- No changes required to application code\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 15 or later\r\n- pgvector extension must be available (e.g., using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image)\r\n- Proper permissions to create schemas and extensions\r\n",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the application lacks payment processing capabilities through Coinbase Commerce, limiting user interactions and monetization options.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement integration with Coinbase Commerce to allow users to create and manage payment charges directly through the application. This should include functionality for creating charges, checking charge statuses, and handling payments securely.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nUsing other payment gateways, but they may not align with our existing infrastructure or user base.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nIntegrating with Coinbase Commerce will enhance the application's functionality and provide a seamless payment experience for users.\n\n**Related Issues/PRs**\n- [Issue #1665](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1665) - Adding Twilio plugin for voice interactions.\n- [Issue #1677](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1677) - Request for HTTP proxy support for AI agents.",

Network Stack\r\n- Defaults to IPv6 (::1) when resolving `localhost`\r\n- More strict separation between localhost and IP address bindings\r\n- Requires explicit permissions for network interface bindings\r\n- More complex security model with Windows Firewall\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- Stricter access control policies\r\n- Requires explicit configuration to allow applications to bind to all interfaces\r\n- May require administrator privileges for certain network operations\r\n- Different handling for IPv4 and IPv6 connections\r\n\r\n3. Common Issues\r\n- EACCES errors when binding to ports\r\n- Permission problems with localhost access\r\n- IPv4/IPv6 conflicts in network applications\r\n- Needs explicit host configuration in development servers\r\n\r\n## macOS Behavior\r\n1. Network Stack\r\n- Unified handling of `localhost` resolution\r\n- Seamless integration between IPv4 and IPv6\r\n- More permissive default network interface bindings\r\n- Simplified security model\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- More lenient default permissions\r\n- Automatic handling of localhost-to-IP routing\r\n- Better integration between different network interfaces\r\n- Less restrictive port binding policies\r\n\r\n3. Advantages\r\n- \"It just works\" approach to localhost\r\n- Better default security without sacrificing developer experience\r\n- More consistent behavior across different network configurations\r\n- Less configuration needed for development environments\r\n\r\n## Development Impact\r\nThis is why development servers like Vite require different configurations:\r\n- Windows needs `host: true` to allow IP access\r\n- macOS works without special configuration\r\n- Windows often needs explicit IP addresses (127.0.0.1)\r\n- macOS handles localhost resolution more intelligently",

The main risks are:\r\n\r\n- Rate limiting from CoinMarketCap API (Stricter limits compared to CoinGecko)\r\n- Potential timeout issues when the API is slow\r\n- Invalid cryptocurrency symbols causing failed requests\r\n- Cost implications as CoinMarketCap API is a paid service\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Adds a new CoinMarketCap plugin for cryptocurrency price checking\r\n- Implements a `GET_PRICE` action that fetches current prices using the v1 API\r\n- Provides TypeScript types and interfaces for CoinMarketCap API responses\r\n- Includes environment validation for API key configuration\r\n- Adds proper error handling for API calls and symbol validation\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality):\r\n\r\n- New plugin implementation\r\n- New paid API integration\r\n- New TypeScript types and validation\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n\r\n- Add CoinMarketCap plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required API key configuration\r\n- Add usage examples for price checking\r\n- Update plugin list in main documentation\r\n- Add pricing/rate limit considerations\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the plugin implementation in `/plugin-coinmarketcap/src/`\r\n2. Check the main action implementation in `index.ts`\r\n3. Verify API service in `service.ts`\r\n4. Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n5. Check template handling in `template.ts`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2.

Extended CoinGecko Integration:\r\n   - Support all coins listed on CoinGecko (currently ~10,000+ cryptocurrencies)\r\n   - Add coin metadata (market cap, volume, supply)\r\n   - Include historical price data and charts\r\n   - Support multiple currency conversions in a single query\r\n\r\n2. Additional API Features:\r\n   - `/simple/supported_vs_currencies` - Add support for all available fiat currencies\r\n   - `/coins/markets` - Include detailed market data\r\n   - `/coins/{id}/tickers` - Add exchange-specific price data\r\n   - `/coins/{id}/market_chart` - Support price charts and historical analysis\r\n   - `/global` - Add global crypto market metrics\r\n   - `/search` - Implement fuzzy search for coin names\r\n   - `/exchange_rates` - Support BTC-to-fiat conversion rates\r\n   - `/trending` - Add trending coins information\r\n\r\n3.

Here are the key points:\r\n\r\n\u2705 The number of sections in the English and Romanian README files match, indicating the overall structure is similar. \r\n\r\n\u2705 Key phrases and core content appear to be translated accurately in the Romanian version.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f However, the section titles and ordering don't match exactly between the two versions.\r\n\r\n## Section Differences\r\n\r\nThe Romanian README has sections that don't appear to have direct equivalents in the English version:\r\n\r\n- `## Rularea cu modele diferite` (Running with different models)\r\n- `## Cerin\u021be suplimentare` (Additional requirements)\r\n- `## Telegram` \r\n- `## Bot Discord`\r\n- `## Teste` (Tests)\r\n\r\nThese sections seem to provide more details on configuring and running the bot with different models, setting up specific clients like Telegram and Discord, and running tests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the English README has some sections missing in the Romanian version:\r\n\r\n- `## \ud83c\udf0d README Translations`\r\n- `## Video Tutorials`\r\n- `## \ud83d\ude80 Quick Start`\r\n- `## Contributors`\r\n- `## Star History`\r\n\r\nSo the Romanian version is missing information on alternate translations, video tutorials, a quick start guide, contributor info, and star history.\r\n\r\nSome section titles that do overlap have different names:\r\n- `## \u2728 Features` (EN) vs `## Func\u021bionalit\u0103\u021bi` (RO)\r\n- `## \ud83c\udfaf Use Cases` (EN) vs `## Pentru ce pot s\u0103-l folosesc?` (RO)\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\n\r\nTo fully align the English and Romanian READMEs, consider the following:\r\n\r\n1. Add the additional technical sections from the Romanian version to the English README where appropriate, to cover those extra details.\r\n\r\n2. Translate the meta project info sections from the English version and add them to the Romanian README.\r\n\r\n3. Rename the overlapping sections to match between the two versions for consistency.\r\n\r\n4. Review the ordering of sections and adjust as needed so they follow the same logical flow in both versions.\r\n\r\nOverall the translation looks good in terms of the core content, just needs some structural alignment.

The current multi-page approach requires extra navigation steps to switch between agents. This redesign aims to simplify the experience by making it easier to switch between conversations while maintaining context.\r\n\r\n- Removes the multi-page routing structure in favor of a single-page chat interface\r\n- Implements a collapsible sidebar containing agent selection\r\n- Adds a chat-like interface with agent header and message thread\r\n- Integrates theme toggle into the new sidebar\r\n- Adds avatar generation for agents using DiceBear\r\n- Improves overall UI/UX with modern chat application patterns\r\n\r\n## Questions to Consider\r\n1. Is chat the primary interaction mode we want to focus on?\r\n2. Is there a specific planned feature roadmap for `client` app?\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Start with `client/src/Agents.tsx` to review the new main layout structure\r\n2. Review `client/src/Chat.tsx` to see the simplified chat component\r\n3. Check the router changes in `client/src/router.tsx`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Launch the application and verify the new sidebar layout appears\r\n2. Test sidebar collapse/expand functionality\r\n3. Select different agents and verify chat history remains isolated\r\n4. Test theme toggle in the new sidebar location\r\n5. Verify message sending/receiving still works as expected\r\n6. Test responsive design at various screen sizes\r\n7. Verify avatar generation for each agent\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![eliza_chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0035a547-8721-4fee-8b50-b16283c31a0b)\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard deployment - no special steps required.\r\n",

Does setting TWITTER_TARGET_USERS make the AI agent ignore other user's mentions / replies?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n1. The users in the list should be the users that the ai agent focuses on, retweets, replies to.\r\n\r\n2. Should still be able to interact with any and all users even if not on the list.",
