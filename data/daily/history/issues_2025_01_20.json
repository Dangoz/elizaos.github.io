    "body": "\n\nCurrently, Eliza agents lack integrated web search capabilities, limiting their ability to access and retrieve up-to-date information from the internet. This constraint hampers their performance in tasks requiring real-time data or comprehensive knowledge beyond their pre-existing datasets.\n\nDescribe the solution you’d like\n\nIntegrate SearXNG, a free and open-source metasearch engine, into the Eliza framework. SearXNG aggregates results from various search services and databases without tracking or profiling users, aligning with privacy considerations. By embedding SearXNG, Eliza agents can perform real-time web searches, enhancing their ability to provide accurate and current information.  ￼\n\nDescribe alternatives you’ve considered\n\t•\tDeveloping a Custom Search Integration: Creating a proprietary search solution tailored to Eliza’s needs. However, this approach would require significant development resources and ongoing maintenance to ensure comprehensive coverage and relevance of search results.\n\t•\tUtilizing Other Search APIs: Leveraging existing search engine APIs (e.g., Google, Bing). While feasible, these options may involve usage costs, rate limitations, and potential privacy concerns due to data tracking practices.\n\nAdditional context\n\nSearXNG is a fork of the Searx project, designed to provide faster debugging and fixes of engine errors. It supports over 70 different search engines and does not collect information about users, ensuring privacy.  ￼ Integrating SearXNG into Eliza would involve setting up a SearXNG instance, which can be configured optimally for use with applications like Open WebUI.  ￼ This integration would significantly enhance Eliza agents’ capabilities by providing them with access to a vast array of information sources in real-time.",
