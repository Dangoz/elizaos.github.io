The new modular approach will eventually replace `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray` but poses no immediate impact on existing functionality.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the `generateObject` function by introducing a modular approach to handle AI model generation and parsing. The update addresses issue #148, which details inconsistencies in JSON response formatting from the LLM. For instance, action values like `NONE` are inconsistently quoted, causing JSON parsing errors that disrupt program logic. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces provider-specific handlers within `generateObject`, allowing standardized JSON parsing for each model type and reducing the need for custom error-handling code. This is the first part of a two-stage update, with a follow-up PR to fully deprecate `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray` in favor of this approach.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: Increases reliability by introducing structured, provider-specific handling.\r\n- **Refactor**: Simplifies `generateObject` and centralizes model-specific parsing logic.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- **Yes**: Documentation should reflect the updated `generateObject` design and the role of provider-specific handlers.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nReview `generateObject`, which now routes requests through `handleProvider`, using specific handlers (e.g., `handleOpenAI`, `handleAnthropic`) that configure JSON response handling for each model. This centralizes parsing and prepares for structured output where supported.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n- Run unit tests on `generateObject` to confirm JSON parsing accuracy with new handlers.\r\n- Test across different AI model providers, especially OpenAI, to ensure JSON responses adhere to expected formats.\r\n- Check logs for consistent error handling and retry logic.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Problem:**\r\n\r\nOur open-source project is experiencing rapid growth with numerous contributions from our community members. While we have the infrastructure to create releases, we currently face challenges in ensuring that these releases are reliable and stable. The key issues are:\r\n\r\n- **Broken Test Suite:** Our automated tests are failing, which means we cannot confidently verify the stability and functionality of new code changes.\r\n- **Rapid Code Changes:** With many contributors and fast-moving code, it's difficult to track and integrate changes without introducing new bugs.\r\n- **Unreliable Releases:** Without a consistent and dependable release process, we risk distributing versions of our project that may not meet quality standards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges and establish a reliable release process, we propose the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Prioritize Fixing the Tests:**\r\n   - **Assess and Repair Tests:** Identify all failing tests and determine the causes. Fix broken tests to ensure they accurately reflect code functionality.\r\n   - **Community Involvement:** Encourage contributors to help fix tests by creating specific issues and assigning tasks.\r\n   - Testing issues can be found with the 'testing' label: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesting\r\n\r\n2. **Establish Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - **Automate Testing:** Set up a CI system to automatically run the test suite on every commit and pull request. For the most part this is already in place but only runs a basic test currently.\r\n   - **Enforce Test Passing:** Configure the CI to block merging of code that doesn't pass all tests, keeping the main branch stable. We currently have these running on every pull request, but it's not a blocking rule.\r\n\r\n3. **Implement a Branching Strategy:**\r\n   - **Use Feature Branches:** Have contributors work on separate branches for new features or fixes to isolate changes. For the most part this is happening already.\r\n   - **Adopt Release Branches:** Create dedicated branches for preparing releases, allowing for final testing and stabilization.\r\n\r\n4. **Define a Release Workflow:**\r\n   - **Release Types:** Clearly define different release types (e.g., alpha, beta, stable) and their purposes.\r\n   - **Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning to communicate the nature of changes in each release.\r\n\r\n5. **Automate the Release Process:**\r\n   - **Automated Builds and Tagging:** Utilize tools to automate the building of releases and tagging of versions.\r\n   - **Generate Release Notes:** Automatically create release notes from commit messages to document changes. This is already in place and is updated when a tag is created through CI: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n6. **Establish Release Criteria:**\r\n   - **Set Clear Requirements:** Define what must be completed before a release (passing tests, code reviews, updated documentation).\r\n   - **Use a Release Checklist:** Implement a checklist to ensure all criteria are met before releasing.\r\n\r\n7. **Enhance Collaboration and Communication:**\r\n   - **Regular Updates:** Hold regular meetings or send updates to keep everyone informed about release progress.\r\n   - **Transparency:** Make the release roadmap and plans accessible to all contributors.\r\n\r\n8. **Implement Code Reviews and Quality Assurance:**\r\n   - **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other contributor. We've talked about this in discord, but it hasn't been implemented as a rule yet.\r\n   - **Use Quality Tools:** Integrate static analysis and other quality assurance tools to catch issues early.\r\n\r\n9. **Plan for Different Release Channels:**\r\n   - **Stable Releases:** Provide thoroughly tested versions for general use.\r\n   - **Beta and Nightly Builds:** Offer less stable versions for testing new features and gathering feedback.\r\n\r\n10. **Monitor and Iterate:**\r\n    - **Collect Feedback:** After each release, gather input from users and contributors to identify improvements.\r\n    - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refine the release process based on feedback and performance metrics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n- **Immediate Actions:**\r\n  - **Fix the Test Suite:** Prioritize repairing all broken tests with the help of the community.\r\n  - **Set Up CI System:** Implement a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and enforce code quality.\r\n\r\n- **Community Engagement:**\r\n  - **Communicate Plans:** Share this proposed solution with the community to align efforts and expectations.\r\n  - **Encourage Participation:** Invite contributors to take active roles in improving the testing and release processes.\r\n\r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - **Create Guidelines:** Document the release workflow, branching strategy, and contribution guidelines.\r\n  - **Provide Resources:** Offer tutorials or guides on how to work with the new processes and tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy taking these steps, we aim to build a robust and reliable release process that can handle rapid development while maintaining high-quality standards. This will not only improve the stability of our releases but also enhance collaboration within our community, ultimately leading to a better project for all users and contributors.",

            "body": "**Description:**\r\n\r\nThe Eliza project is gaining traction, and many developers are forking the repository to create custom agents or specialized implementations. This distributed development model is a strength, but it also creates a challenge: managing code divergence and ensuring interoperability across the growing Eliza ecosystem. This ticket aims to establish a community-driven plan for addressing this challenge, fostering collaboration, and maximizing code reuse while allowing for customization and innovation within individual forks.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\n* **Multiple Diverging Forks:** As more developers fork Eliza, the ecosystem will naturally fragment into various specialized implementations.\r\n* **Increased Merge Complexity:** Merging changes between forks, or between forks and the main repository, will become increasingly complex and error-prone as divergence increases.\r\n* **Maintenance Overhead:**  Each fork incurs its own maintenance burden, requiring developers to track upstream changes, resolve merge conflicts, and ensure compatibility.\r\n* **Duplication of Effort and Reinventing the Wheel:** Developers in different forks might unknowingly duplicate efforts by re-implementing similar features.\r\n* **Reduced Interoperability:**  Divergence can lead to reduced interoperability between different Eliza agents or implementations.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* **Minimize Divergence (Where Feasible):** Encourage practices that minimize unnecessary code divergence across forks.\r\n* **Facilitate Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Foster communication and collaboration between maintainers of different forks and the core Eliza team.\r\n* **Streamline Merging and Integration:** Establish best practices and potentially develop tools for efficiently merging changes between forks and the main repository.\r\n* **Maximize Code Reuse:**  Promote modular design and encourage the development of reusable plugins and components that can be shared across the ecosystem.\r\n* **Maintain Core Eliza Stability:**  Ensure that core Eliza functionality remains stable and reliable while allowing for innovation and customization within forks.\r\n\r\n**Near-Term Plan (Community-Driven):**\r\n\r\n1. **Fork Registry (Website or GitHub Page):** Create a central registry of known Eliza forks. This registry could include project descriptions, contact information for maintainers, and links to the forked repositories.  This facilitates discovery and collaboration.\r\n\r\n2. **Communication Channels (Discord, Forum):**  Establish dedicated communication channels (e.g., a Discord server, a forum category) for discussing fork management, sharing best practices, and coordinating development efforts.\r\n\r\n3. **Modularization and Plugin Development:**  Encourage developers to refactor fork-specific code into modular plugins or extensions that can be easily shared and integrated with other Eliza implementations.\r\n\r\n4. **Standardized Plugin Interface:**  Develop and document a clear, standardized interface for creating Eliza plugins.  This promotes interoperability and simplifies plugin integration.\r\n\r\n5. **Shared Test Suite:**  Create a shared test suite that covers core Eliza functionality.  Encourage fork maintainers to incorporate this test suite into their continuous integration pipelines to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n6. **Documentation:**  Create documentation and tutorials on best practices for forking Eliza, managing divergence, and contributing back to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Future Considerations (Speculative):**\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Merging Tools:**  Explore and potentially develop automated merging tools that can help resolve conflicts and integrate changes between forks more efficiently.\r\n2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) Workflows:** Investigate whether alternative version control systems or workflows (like Git submodules or subtree merging) could facilitate managing multiple forks.\r\n3. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol:** If AI-driven code synchronization is a long-term goal, develop a protocol or language for communication between agents managing different forks.\r\n4. **Federated Learning for Agents:**  Explore the potential of federated learning techniques, allowing agents in different forks to collaboratively train and improve shared models without directly exchanging sensitive data.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n* A community-driven plan is established and documented for managing divergence across the Eliza ecosystem.\r\n* The plan includes specific steps for facilitating collaboration, streamlining merging, maximizing code reuse, and maintaining core Eliza stability.\r\n* The plan is actively communicated and promoted within the Eliza community.\r\n* Tools and resources (fork registry, communication channels, shared test suite) are created to support the plan's implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket expands the scope to address the broader challenge of managing multiple forks within the Eliza ecosystem. The key shift is towards a community-driven approach, emphasizing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the development of shared resources and standards. This fosters a more vibrant and sustainable ecosystem while allowing individual forks the flexibility to innovate and adapt Eliza to their specific needs.",
