            "body": "Original Code (Before Fix)\r\n\r\nThe original code was truncating tweets incorrectly, often cutting them off mid-sentence. The logic did not ensure that tweets ended at a complete sentence or whitespace, leading to awkward, incomplete posts.\r\nProblematic Section\r\n\r\nconst contentLength = 240;\r\n\r\nlet content = slice.slice(0, contentLength);\r\n// if its bigger than 280, delete the last line\r\nif (content.length > 280) {\r\n    content = content.slice(0, content.lastIndexOf(\"\\n\"));\r\n}\r\nif (content.length > contentLength) {\r\n    // slice at the last period\r\n    content = content.slice(0, content.lastIndexOf(\".\"));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// if it's still too long, get the period before the last period\r\nif (content.length > contentLength) {\r\n    content = content.slice(0, content.lastIndexOf(\".\"));\r\n}\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n\r\n    It arbitrarily truncated content at contentLength (240 characters) without ensuring logical sentence breaks.\r\n    The logic to truncate at the last period (.) or newline (\\n) was insufficient for tweets lacking such characters.\r\n    The fallback mechanism could still produce incomplete sentences.\r\n\r\nUpdated Code (After Fix)\r\n\r\nWe introduced a new helper function, truncateToCompleteSentence, to properly truncate the text. This function ensures that:\r\n\r\n    Tweets end at a logical sentence break (e.g., a period).\r\n    If no periods are found, tweets truncate at the nearest whitespace and append an ellipsis (...).\r\n    As a last resort, it hard-truncates the text while adding an ellipsis for readability.\r\n\r\nFixed Section\r\n\r\nconst MAX_TWEET_LENGTH = 280;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Truncate text to fit within the Twitter character limit, ensuring it ends at a complete sentence.\r\n */\r\nfunction truncateToCompleteSentence(text: string): string {\r\n    if (text.length <= MAX_TWEET_LENGTH) {\r\n        return text;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Attempt to truncate at the last period within the limit\r\n    const truncatedAtPeriod = text.slice(0, text.lastIndexOf(\".\", MAX_TWEET_LENGTH) + 1);\r\n    if (truncatedAtPeriod.trim().length > 0) {\r\n        return truncatedAtPeriod.trim();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // If no period is found, truncate to the nearest whitespace\r\n    const truncatedAtSpace = text.slice(0, text.lastIndexOf(\" \", MAX_TWEET_LENGTH));\r\n    if (truncatedAtSpace.trim().length > 0) {\r\n        return truncatedAtSpace.trim() + \"...\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Fallback: Hard truncate and add ellipsis\r\n    return text.slice(0, MAX_TWEET_LENGTH - 3).trim() + \"...\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Inside the generateNewTweet function:\r\nconst formattedTweet = newTweetContent.replaceAll(/\\\\n/g, \"\\n\").trim();\r\nconst content = truncateToCompleteSentence(formattedTweet);\r\n\r\nKey Improvements\r\n\r\n    Helper Function: The truncateToCompleteSentence function centralizes truncation logic and ensures consistent handling.\r\n    Logical Truncation:\r\n        First tries to truncate at a period (.).\r\n        Falls back to whitespace if no period is found.\r\n        Finally hard-truncates with an ellipsis if necessary.\r\n    Replaced Inline Logic: The old logic was replaced with a single call to the helper function, ensuring clean and maintainable code.",

Is there a recommended Node.js version or additional configuration that I should use?",
