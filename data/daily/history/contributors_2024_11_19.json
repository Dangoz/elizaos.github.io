Specifically, the errors occur because the `Plugin` type does not include a `clients` property.\r\n\r\nThe following errors are observed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/index.ts:206:24 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n206             if (plugin.clients) {\r\n                           ~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nsrc/index.ts:207:45 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n207                 for (const client of plugin.clients) {\r\n                                                ~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to originate from an outdated or incorrect type definition for `Plugin`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\r\n2. Run the following commands:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   pnpm install\r\n   pnpm start --characters=\"characters/character.character.json\"\r\n   ```\r\n3. Observe the TypeScript build errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nThe project should successfully build and start without errors. Type definitions for `Plugin` should include the `clients` property, or the code should handle cases where `clients` is not defined.\r\n",

Test functionality:\r\n   ```env\r\n   # Test with simple name\r\n   CHARACTER.TESTBOT.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test\r\n   \r\n   # Test with spaces in name\r\n   CHARACTER.MY_TEST_BOT.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-other\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Documentation Testing\r\nReview updated docs:\r\n- docs/docs/guides/secrets-management.md\r\n- docs/docs/guides/configuration.md\r\n- docs/docs/packages/agent.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Feature Testing:\r\n   - Create character with spaces in name\r\n   - Add namespaced variables to .env\r\n   - Verify correct loading into character settings\r\n   - Test precedence over character.json settings\r\n   - Verify backward compatibility\r\n   - Test global fallback behavior\r\n\r\n2. Documentation Verification:\r\n   - Verify pattern examples are correct\r\n   - Verify hierarchy explanation is clear\r\n   - Verify character name handling is explained\r\n   - Test example configurations\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nN/A - Feature implementation and documentation changes\r\n",

Given it is of medium risk, can we add a quick unit test to confirm that the cascading logic (in terms of where to read the settings) works as expected. If you don't want to include this in this PR no worries create a ticket and TODO comment. But please confirm on your machine that the precedence is honored re: \r\n\r\n1. Character-specific namespaced environment variables (highest priority)\r\n2. Character-specific secrets\r\n3. Environment variables\r\n4. Default values (lowest priority)\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"
