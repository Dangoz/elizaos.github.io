This could impact developer onboarding or quick start workflows if broken.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves a bug that causes `elizaos test` to fail immediately after creating a plugin or project with `elizaos create`. The error observed includes a `SyntaxError` and a `TypeError`, preventing developers from running tests on newly scaffolded plugins like `plugin-twitter`.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [x] My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- [ ] My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nStart by reviewing the changes to the test scaffold or plugin creation template, especially in files that affect test generation or module exports.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Run `cd packages/plugin-twitter`\r\n2. Run `elizaos test`\r\n3. Verify that no `SyntaxError` or `TypeError` occurs\r\n4. Confirm that the test suite runs and passes successfully\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1203d732-a341-4831-aea8-5321841eeca4)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query.
