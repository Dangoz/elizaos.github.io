From the DEBUG trace it's also clear that it received a response from the Venice model. Which leads me to suspect that the code for Venice is missing from the switch statement\nAlso I can chat with the agent on the  http://localhost:5173/ interface using Venice.\n\nThe way to replicate the error is to setup an agent that uses the Venice API, and see if it can generate a tweet. \n"

    "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\n`parseJSONObjectFromText` broke for me in or before 0.25.9\nIt was working OK for me in 0.18\n\nThe problem imo is the `normalizeJSONString` function.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Run `node` interpreter in your eliza repo.\n2. Run the following:\n```\nconst { parseJSONObjectFromText, cleanJsonResponse } = await import(\"@elizaos/core\");\n\nlet text = '```json{    \"success\": true,    \"result\": {        \"serviceAdCID\": \"zdpuB1ZVfhZFX4iaVhXkyhTuGUhPA1Ac3LuQdSWe9zcdXrKce\",        \"wallet\": \"9ovkK7WoiSXyEJDM5cZG3or3W95bdzZLDDHhuMgSJT9U\",        \"desiredServiceID\": \"Landing Page Creation\",        \"desiredUnitAmount\": \"1\"    }}```'\n\nparseJSONObjectFromText(text)\n```\nYou will see an error, and then the code tries to handle it by doing `extractAttributes(text)`\nBut `extractAttributesText` cannot handle nested objects.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb0d3bc-c662-4f4b-b3b3-59ab0e2f02a0)\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nIn my opinion, running the text through `cleanJsonResponse` and then `JSON.parse` should be enough, as `JSON.parse` handles a lot of the stuff that `normalizeJSONString` is trying to handle.\n\nAdditionally, the code should fail if `JSON.parse` can't parse it, instead of trying to fix the problem with `extractAttributesText`.\nThat way the user can fix their AI prompt.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da93c13d-ede8-4e50-bc83-5e069dfa36b3)\n\n\n**Additional context**\n\nHappy to help with this and write some test cases around it. Documenting the issue in case someone gets to it before me.",
