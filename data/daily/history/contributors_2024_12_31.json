List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates the **FereAI APIs** using the `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK` module and update the **FerePro Plugin**, enhancing functionality to handle `ChatResponse` objects with better granularity. The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

It doesn't seem to like posts, repost or quote.\n\nUsing main I can get it to post quotes but it posts them in JSON format. No matter what I do I cannot seem to remove the formatting. It also still tweets even with explicit instructions not to.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA clear and functional system for configuring what actions the agent can take on twitter or some helpful direction on configuration.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nNew to everything (Building ai agents, working with typescript, GitHub, etc.)",

The only integration point is through the plugin system which is designed for extensibility.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a new Hummingbot plugin that enables Eliza agents to perform automated market making and trading operations. The plugin provides:\r\n- Real-time market data streaming via WebSocket\r\n- Simple market making strategy with configurable parameters\r\n- Order lifecycle management (create, cancel, track)\r\n- Inventory skew management\r\n- Type-safe configuration and error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation as the plugin includes its own comprehensive README.md with installation, configuration, and usage instructions.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the plugin's architecture in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check the market making strategy implementation in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/strategies/simple-market-making.ts`\r\n3. Review type definitions and configuration interface in `packages/plugin-hummingbot/src/types.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`\r\n2. Configure Hummingbot instance details in your character config:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": [\"@eliza/plugin-hummingbot\"],\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"HUMMINGBOT_CONFIG\": {\r\n      \"instance\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"http://localhost:15888\",\r\n        \"apiKey\": \"your-api-key\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the system is limited to using TiktokenModel for token trimming, which restricts compatibility with non-OpenAI models. This limitation may hinder the integration of diverse models that could enhance performance and scalability.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a flexible token trimming mechanism that supports a variety of models beyond TiktokenModel. This could involve abstracting the token trimming logic to accommodate different model architectures and tokenization strategies.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nContinuing with the current model-specific approach, but this would limit the flexibility and potential for optimization across different models.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nExpanding support for non-OpenAI models will improve the system's adaptability and allow for better optimization of token trimming processes. This aligns with the goal of enhancing algorithm efficiency and scalability.\n\n**Related Issues**\n\nNone at the moment, but tracking this enhancement will facilitate discussions around implementation strategies.",
