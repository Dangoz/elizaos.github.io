If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nAutonomous Agents that trade onchain have a root of trust problem that requires a human to generate a wallet and provide a private key as part of the environment variables. This is a problem since humans can easily inject themselves into the process and make it easy for them to build ruggable agents. This solution aims to give users some verifiability with remote attestation and allow agents to autonomously generate their wallet within the TEE based on a secret salt instead of a private key. Now agents have a the autonomy to perform actions onchain without the possibility of a human manipulating the wallet since the human can no longer know what the private key since it is generated within the TEE.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

He wants it to be driven by the agent's decision-making process, not chance. The aim is for the image generation to be handled within the agent, not the Twitter client\"\r\n\r\nThere were a few things he said needed to be done. One of them a `none` action handler to better manage actions and responses.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind I'm going to close this and revisit later with better logic."
