The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt _packages/core/src/generate.ts_ When the `imageModelProvider` did not match `modelProvider`, the code iteratively checked for API keys in a fallback chain. It stopped at the first available key (e.g., FAL_API_KEY), even if it belonged to the wrong provider. As a result, the selected API key could be incorrect (e.g., returning and using a key from FAL instead key from Venice).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set imageModelProvider to VENICE in the character configuration.\r\n2. Provide both FAL_API_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in .env(or any other relevant key combination).\r\n3. When requesting an image generation observe that the code selects FAL_API_KEY instead of VENICE_API_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a specific imageModelProvider is set, the code should return the matching API key for that provider if it exists. If no specific provider key is found, the code should then try the fallback chain in sequence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c086855-48b3-42ba-b410-6f87c2513711)\r\n\r\n**Fix** \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59fae1b-652c-41e1-9540-fa2c2a85cba7)\r\n\r\n`const apiKey =\r\n    runtime.imageModelProvider === runtime.modelProvider\r\n        ? runtime.token\r\n        : (() => {\r\n            // First try to match the specific provider\r\n            switch (runtime.imageModelProvider) {\r\n                case ModelProviderName.HEURIST:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.TOGETHER:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.FAL:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.OPENAI:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.VENICE:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n                default:\r\n                    // If no specific match, try the fallback chain\r\n                    return (runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n            }\r\n        })();`\r\n\r\nThis fix updates the logic to first attempt to retrieve the API key from the specifically selected imageModelProvider. If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE.\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

You can STILL keep all your keys directly in .env, but if you specify \"SECRET_NAMES\" in your .env, it will pull secrets through that from AWS along with anything in the .env\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create an AWS account. Free-tier is enough. \r\n2. In Secrets Manager, create a secret named \"secret/myagentname\" (this can be named anything but this format is nice). \r\n3. Add in all the keys you have in your .env currently as key value pairs in this secret and save.\r\n\r\n### IAM Role Setup:\r\nFirst, create an IAM Policy:\r\n\r\nGo to AWS Console \u2192 IAM \u2192 Policies \u2192 Create Policy\r\nSelect JSON and use this policy document:\r\n\r\njsonCopy{\r\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\r\n    \"Statement\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n            \"Action\": [\r\n                \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\r\n                \"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"Resource\": [\r\n                \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:secret:*\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\nName it something like \"SecretsManagerReadAccess\"\r\n\r\n### Create the IAM Role:\r\n\r\nGo to IAM \u2192 Roles \u2192 Create Role\r\nChoose your use case:\r\n\r\nFor EC2: Select \"AWS service\" and \"EC2\"\r\nFor Lambda: Select \"AWS service\" and \"Lambda\"\r\nFor other services: Choose appropriate trust relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAttach the policy you just created (\"SecretsManagerReadAccess\")\r\nName the role (e.g., \"SecretsManagerRole\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Get the Role ARN:\r\n\r\nAfter creating the role, click into it\r\nCopy the \"Role ARN\" from the summary section\r\nIt will look like: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SecretsManagerRole\r\nThis is what you'll put in your .env file as AWS_ROLE_ARN\r\n\r\n\r\n### If you're using this with EC2:\r\n\r\nAttach this role to your EC2 instance\r\nGo to EC2 \u2192 Select instance \u2192 Actions \u2192 Security \u2192 Modify IAM Role\r\nSelect the role you created\r\n\r\n\r\n### For local development:\r\n\r\nYou'll need AWS credentials configured locally\r\nUse aws configure with credentials that can assume this role\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your new ENV could look like this:\r\nAWS_REGION=us-east-1\r\nSECRET_NAMES=secret/ropAIrito\r\nAWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::[REPLACE WITH YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER WITHOUT THE BRACKETS]:role/secrets-access-role \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT TO NOTE**: You can use the .env just how it has normally been used in the Eliza repo. This is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nSecurity change / cleanup / ease of use\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nJust think it is more secure to pull from secrets manager, especially if people are hosting their agent on AWS, but this will work even if you host elsewhere as long as you have the a service role with secrets manager access specified in the \"AWS_ROLE_ARN\".\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMaybe just an explainer that Secrets Manager is useable with Eliza.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb09a61-fb4e-457a-8209-9eb7e6d53eca)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddcd2b7-8fce-4e0c-8c90-a25af4ce5d3f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a286a34-b560-4adb-b633-acb6a1209969)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd96be74-4966-41a2-babc-7e4c625bdbbe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166014ea-9185-4bb0-b2d7-433c5ac50e25)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nTake a look at settings.ts in the core package. \r\n\r\n### Discord Username\r\n\r\nropirito",

            "body": "## Description\r\nWhile setting up Discord bots with multiple characters, I encountered and resolved an issue with Discord token resolution. This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes. ",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, our logging for the Coinbase plugin lacks structured formats and essential context, making it challenging to debug issues effectively and trace requests across services.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a structured logging framework that:\n- Uses JSON format for all logs.\n- Includes standard fields such as timestamp, severity, and correlation ID.\n- Supports context injection for better observability.\n- Has different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).\n- Allows adding custom fields relevant to the Coinbase plugin operations.\n\nFor example, using a logging framework like Winston in Node.js:\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\nlogger.info('User login attempt', { userId: '12345', correlationId: 'abc-123' });\n```\nThis will greatly assist in correlating events and debugging any issues that may arise.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Relying on plain text logs, which can be cumbersome to parse and analyze.\n- Using manual JSON formatting, which is error-prone.\n- Implementing APM tools without a standardized logging approach.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhancing our logging practices will lead to better monitoring, easier log aggregation, and a more consistent logging pattern, ultimately improving our overall observability and debugging capabilities.",
