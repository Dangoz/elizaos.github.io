    "body": "# PR: Enhance ElizaOS Plugin Development and Publishing Workflow\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the complete plugin lifecycle - from creation to development to publishing - with a focus on streamlining the developer experience and ensuring plugins work correctly within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\r\n\r\n## Key Improvements\r\n\r\n1. **Proper Plugin Naming**:\r\n   * Modified template generation to dynamically replace the hardcoded plugin name in source files with the actual plugin name\r\n   * Ensures plugins use the correct name at runtime in dev/start mode\r\n\r\n2. **Registry Publishing Requirements**:\r\n   * Added missing required components to plugin templates:\r\n   * Added images/ directory with detailed README\r\n   * Added agentConfig section to package.json\r\n   * Properly formatted repository URL with placeholders\r\n\r\n3. **Plugin Template Enhancements**:\r\n   * Updated success message in create.ts with clearer next steps\r\n   * Improved plugin README.md with more detailed guidance\r\n   * Added proper configuration schema validation\r\n\r\n4. **Developer Experience Improvements**:\r\n   * Preserved custom changes to template files during builds\r\n   * Fixed repository URL format to use the correct GitHub pattern\r\n   * Enhanced plugin startup and error logging\r\n\r\n5. **Plugin Publishing Workflow**:\r\n   * Implemented validation for plugin requirements before publishing\r\n   * Improved the GitHub PR flow for registry submissions\r\n   * Added clearer feedback messages during the publishing process\r\n   * Added guided inputs for plugin description and other metadata\r\n\r\n## Plugin Publishing Validation\r\n\r\nThe plugin publishing validation (`npx elizaos plugin publish --test`) now checks against the ElizaOS registry PR template requirements:\r\n\r\n* Verification of public GitHub repository accessibility\r\n* Validation of 'main' as the default branch\r\n* Checking for the 'elizaos-plugins' topic in repository settings\r\n* Repository description presence\r\n* Directory structure validation:\r\n  * Presence of images/ directory with logo.jpg and banner.jpg\r\n  * Proper image file sizes and formats\r\n  * Source code structure (src/index.ts, etc.)\r\n* Package.json validation:\r\n  * Proper agentConfig section\r\n  * Correct repository URL format\r\n  * Required plugin parameters\r\n\r\n## Testing Performed\r\n\r\n1. **Plugin Creation**:\r\n   * Verified template files contain all required components\r\n   * Confirmed that the correct package name is used in all places\r\n   * Validated directory structure is correct, including images folder\r\n\r\n2. **Plugin Development**:\r\n   * Tested the dev command with hot-reloading\r\n   * Confirmed plugin actions are registered and triggered correctly\r\n   * Verified log output shows the correct plugin name\r\n\r\n3. **Plugin Startup**:\r\n   * Tested the start command for launching plugins\r\n   * Validated service initialization sequence\r\n   * Confirmed plugin loads with the correct name\r\n\r\n4. **Plugin Publishing**:\r\n   * Tested the plugin publish --test validation workflow\r\n   * Verified repository URL formatting and template replacement\r\n   * Confirmed PR creation flow to the registry repo\r\n   * Validated proper forking of the registry repository\r\n\r\n## UX Improvements\r\n\r\n* Added clearer step-by-step guidance during the plugin publishing process\r\n* Added prompts to create required assets like logo and banner\r\n* Improved error messaging to help developers fix issues\r\n* Enhanced console output with visual formatting and emojis\r\n* Added dynamic input for plugin descriptions and GitHub username\r\n\r\n## Commands Tested (in order)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx elizaos create -t plugin [name/plugin-name]\r\ncd plugin-name\r\nnpx elizaos dev\r\nnpx elizaos start\r\nnpx elizaos test (not worked on, tests not written or passing)\r\nnpx elizaos plugin publish --test\r\nnpx elizaos plugin publish\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Future Work Needed\r\n\r\n1. **Registry Integration**: I am not positive if the new plugin is being registered correctly in the registry fork / PR step, this needs a sanity check and guidance.\r\n2. **Testing Framework**: The plugin test command still needs implementation",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai plan` to trigger planning for file edits and PR creation.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai plan` to trigger planning for file edits and PR creation.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Begin with integration.test.ts for an overview of how components interact\r\n2. Review file-structure.test.ts to understand project scaffolding tests\r\n3. Examine actions.test.ts and models.test.ts as they cover core functionality\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nRun the test suite with:\r\n```\r\ncd packages/project-starter\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass with good coverage across the package's functionality.\r\n",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.
