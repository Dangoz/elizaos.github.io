Potential risks include:\r\n\r\n- **Dependency Resolution Changes:** Updates might lead to different versions of dependencies being installed, which could introduce unforeseen issues.\r\n\r\n- **Build or Runtime Errors:** If updated dependencies have breaking changes, they might cause build failures or runtime errors.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file by running `pnpm install -r --no-frozen-lockfile`. This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments. This is particularly important when dependencies have been added, removed, or updated in the `package.json` files.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"285\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 12 18 56\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5421a78e-b3ec-4234-b494-c431e576087a\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the changes in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to understand the updates to dependency resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Clean Install:** Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly with the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n2. **Run Tests:** Execute the test suite using `pnpm test` to verify that all tests pass with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n3. **Build Project:** Attempt to build the project using `pnpm build` to confirm that the build process completes successfully.\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Verification:** Run the application locally to ensure it behaves as expected with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment steps are required. Ensure that the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is included in the deployment to maintain consistency across environments.\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Merge the PR into the main branch.\r\n\r\n2. Pull the latest changes on the deployment environment.\r\n\r\n3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies as per the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n4. Proceed with the standard deployment process.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nN/A ",

Once your agent tries to get an image description from a tweet, you get this error : \r\n\r\n ```\r\n [\"\u25ceProcessing images in tweet for context\"]\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI API error: \r\n   401\r\n   -\r\n   {\"error\":\"Authentication failed\"}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI request failed (attempt\r\n   1\r\n   ):\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI API error: \r\n   401\r\n   -\r\n   {\"error\":\"Authentication failed\"}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI request failed (attempt\r\n   2\r\n   ):\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI API error: \r\n   401\r\n   -\r\n   {\"error\":\"Authentication failed\"}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   OpenAI request failed (attempt\r\n   3\r\n   ):\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   Error in recognizeWithOpenAI:\r\n   {}\r\n\r\n \u26d4 ERRORS\r\n   Error in handleTextOnlyReply:\r\n   {} -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe agent should be able to use the ImageDescriptionService and get a description of the image in the tweet to get more context.\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\nI already implemented the fix and I will do a PR shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

The plugin supports complex queries and integrates with the existing API.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copy and pasting relevant items out of the html comments. -->\r\nRelates to:\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\nCloses #1431\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section is to be filled out before final review and merge. -->\r\nRisks\r\n<!-- Low, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be effected. -->\r\nLow: 1.The plugin has been extensively tested on Apify with millions of executions, ensuring stability and reliability.\r\n2.After adding the current plugin, there is no place to call it yet. The parts involving other modules will be submitted later. For now, please review this plugin first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nWhat does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin for fetching Twitter data reliably and efficiently. It addresses the limitations of using personal Twitter accounts for scraping, such as rate limits and account bans, by leveraging a proven solution that has already processed millions of requests on Apify.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\n<!-- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) Improvements (misc. changes to existing features) Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality) Updates (new versions of included code) -->\r\nFeatures: Adds a new plugin for Twitter data fetching.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. --><!-- ## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work? -->\r\nAI agents require large amounts of high-quality, timely data to function effectively. The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\nIn the `src/tests` directory under my newly added component folder, you can find all the unit tests for the APIs. I ran the command `pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test` and confirmed that all unit tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n`pnpm --filter @elizaos/plugin-twitter-search test`\r\n\r\nVerify that the plugin can fetch Twitter data without login.\r\n\r\nTest the plugin's performance under high concurrency.\r\n\r\nEnsure the plugin handles rate limits and errors gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord username: [kaitoeasyapi]\r\nTwitter: [kaitoEasyApi](https://x.com/kaitoEasyApi)\r\nApify Twitter Actor: https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest\r\n\r\n",

This should be removed so that character card bios can be updated upon restart.  There's not much of a performance gain from caching anyway, as the bio is only loaded once on startup.\r\n\r\ntwitter login Cookies are also cached indefinitely, not sure if that's good or bad, but it doesn't seem right to me as twitter login cookies should eventually expire.",
