            "body": "**Summary**: Implement an automated registry and communication system that enables trading bots to discover each other, communicate efficiently, and trade in a secure and private back channel. \r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nAs the project expands and more instances of the trading bot are forked and installed, there's an opportunity for these bots to be aware of each other's existence and to communicate directly. The goal is to establish a decentralized, automated registry system that allows bots to discover and authenticate each other. Once connected, the bots will communicate through a private back channel to exchange data and execute trades efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Features**:\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Registry System**: \r\n   - Each bot will register itself in a decentralized registry (e.g., using a lightweight P2P network or distributed ledger technology).\r\n   - Bots will periodically update the registry, checking for new bots or changes in status.\r\n   - The registry will include basic metadata to facilitate discovery, like cryptographic keys for authentication.\r\n   - Possibly services a particular bot provides to other bots that they could pay for in the future. (more on this later)\r\n\r\n2. **Private Back Channel Communication**:\r\n   - Implement a secure, real-time communication protocol, potentially leveraging WebRTC or a similar P2P technology.\r\n   - The protocol should ensure encrypted communication between bots, minimizing the risk of interception.\r\n   - Messages will be designed for minimal latency, suitable for rapid data exchange and trading negotiations.\r\n\r\n3. **Authentication and Security**:\r\n   - Use public-private key cryptography for bot authentication, ensuring only legitimate bots can participate in the network.\r\n   - Establish rules for trust and security, with mechanisms to handle untrusted or malicious bots.\r\n\r\n4. **Efficient Trading Protocol**:\r\n   - Design a protocol that allows bots to share and match order books in a streamlined manner.\r\n   - Ensure trades are executed quickly, with minimal delay, using predefined negotiation rules.\r\n   - Incorporate a fallback mechanism if communication or negotiation fails.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**:\r\n- **Speed**: A dedicated, private communication channel will facilitate faster data exchange compared to public platforms.\r\n- **Security**: Encrypted communication ensures that sensitive trading data remains confidential.\r\n- **Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the registry will support the growth of the network without becoming a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**:\r\n- The system should be resilient to potential attacks, like Sybil attacks, by incorporating strong authentication and trust mechanisms.\r\n- Developing a lightweight and efficient protocol is critical to minimize resource usage and latency.\r\n",

                "body": "### Dockerfile Audit and Suggested Improvements\r\n\r\nThe current Dockerfile implementation has several areas that could be improved to enhance performance, security, and maintainability. Here\u2019s a detailed list of suggested changes:\r\n\r\n1. **No `.dockerignore` File**\r\n   - Without a `.dockerignore`, unnecessary files and folders (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, logs) are included in the Docker build context. This increases image size and build time.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files not needed in the container.\r\n\r\n2. **Inefficient Layer Caching**\r\n   - Dependencies are installed multiple times, which prevents effective caching. Additionally, using separate `ADD` commands for configuration files results in multiple layers.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Consolidate the `ADD` commands for configuration files and install dependencies in a single step. Run `pnpm i` only once after adding all configuration files.\r\n\r\n3. **Redundant `RUN pnpm i` Commands**\r\n   - Dependencies are installed three times throughout the Dockerfile, increasing build time.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Install dependencies once, after copying all necessary configuration files, to streamline the build process.\r\n\r\n4. **Lack of Multi-Stage Build for Production**\r\n   - A single-stage build may result in unnecessary development dependencies being included in the final image, which increases image size and introduces security risks.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Use a multi-stage build to separate build dependencies from the final production image, ensuring only essential files are included.\r\n\r\n5. **Unoptimized `CMD` Command**\r\n   - The `CMD [\"tail\", \"-f\", \"/dev/null\"]` keeps the container idle and suggests the container isn\u2019t configured to run the application.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Replace `CMD` with the actual command to start the application, such as `CMD [\"pnpm\", \"start\"]`.\r\n\r\n6. **Direct Inclusion of Environment Variables (`.env` File)**\r\n   - Adding the `.env` file with `ADD` exposes sensitive information in the Docker image. This can pose security risks if the image is pushed to a registry.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Use Docker secrets or pass environment variables at runtime to secure sensitive data.\r\n\r\n7. **Lack of Non-Root User**\r\n   - The container runs as the root user by default, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if exploited.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Create a non-root user and run the application under this user. Example:\r\n     ```Dockerfile\r\n     RUN adduser -D appuser\r\n     USER appuser\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n8. **Missing Port Exposure**\r\n   - If the application is meant to run a service (e.g., a web server), the container should expose the relevant port.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Add an `EXPOSE <port>` statement for documentation and networking purposes.\r\n\r\n9. **Lack of `.npmrc` Caching**\r\n   - If `.npmrc` contains specific registry or authentication settings, it should be added before dependency installation for caching purposes and authentication consistency.\r\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Add `.npmrc` before running `pnpm i` to leverage caching and reduce unnecessary network requests.\r\n\r\n10. **Unused `docs` Directory**\r\n    - Adding `docs` to the image increases its size without being used by the application.\r\n    - **Suggested Fix**: Remove the `docs` directory from the Dockerfile unless it\u2019s necessary for runtime.\r\n\r\n11. **Inconsistent Dependency Installation**\r\n    - Multiple installations of dependencies without clearing caches or pinning versions may lead to conflicts or unexpected updates.\r\n    - **Suggested Fix**: Ensure dependencies are installed consistently in one step, and pin specific versions where possible.\r\n\r\n12. **Missing Health Checks**\r\n    - Without a health check, monitoring systems like Kubernetes cannot accurately assess the container\u2019s health.\r\n    - **Suggested Fix**: Add a health check for better monitoring, e.g.:\r\n      ```Dockerfile\r\n      HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:<port> || exit 1\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Suggested Refactored Dockerfile\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a refactored Dockerfile with the suggested improvements:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\n# Stage 1: Build dependencies in a temporary stage\r\nFROM node:22-alpine AS builder\r\n\r\n# Install required global dependencies\r\nRUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ \\\r\n    && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n\r\n# Set working directory\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copy essential config files\r\nCOPY pnpm-workspace.yaml package.json .npmrc pnpm-lock.yaml ./\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies\r\nRUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile\r\n\r\n# Copy source code\r\nCOPY tsconfig.json ./\r\nCOPY docs ./docs\r\nCOPY packages ./packages\r\nCOPY scripts ./scripts\r\nCOPY characters ./characters\r\nCOPY src ./src\r\n\r\n# Optional: build step if using TypeScript or other build process\r\n# RUN pnpm build\r\n\r\n# Stage 2: Production image\r\nFROM node:22-alpine\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies required for the final runtime\r\nRUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ \\\r\n    && npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n\r\n# Create a non-root user and switch to it\r\nRUN adduser -D appuser\r\nUSER appuser\r\n\r\n# Set working directory\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\n# Copy built files from the builder stage\r\nCOPY --from=builder /app /app\r\n\r\n# Expose application port if running a web server\r\nEXPOSE 3000  # Adjust port as needed\r\n\r\n# Add health check to ensure the app is running\r\nHEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000 || exit 1\r\n\r\n# Set environment variables to configure runtime model settings\r\nENV NODE_ENV=production\r\n# Add more default environment variables if needed, e.g., DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, etc.\r\n\r\n# Default command to run the application\r\nCMD [\"pnpm\", \"start\"]"

Update your Twitter client initialization:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ApprovalQueue } from '@elizaos/client-twitter';\r\n\r\nconst approvalQueue = new ApprovalQueue();\r\nconst twitterClient = new TwitterClient({\r\n  approvalQueue,\r\n  // ... other options\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Handle tweet approvals:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Add tweet to queue\r\nconst tweetId = await twitterClient.queueTweet('Hello, Twitter!');\r\n\r\n// Later, approve or reject\r\nawait twitterClient.approvalQueue.approve(tweetId);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Link to Devin run\r\nhttps://preview.devin.ai/devin/317312e92741467eaca121ebb82f0508\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- [x] Added comprehensive test suite\r\n- [x] All tests passing\r\n- [x] Type-safe implementation\r\n- [x] Error handling verified\r\n- [x] Webhook integration tested\r\n\r\nYou can create the PR by visiting: https://github.com/compose-ai/eliza/pull/new/feature/twitter-approval\r\n",
