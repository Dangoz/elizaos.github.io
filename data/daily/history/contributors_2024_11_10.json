The sql query expects 5 values, but only 4 are passed. `query_match_count` should be used for `LIMIT`\r\n2. The creation of the float array seems off. The `query_input` does not include any comma separated values. The resulting array is `[NaN]`\r\n3. Distance comparison is between a float array and a string. It should probably be compared to `query_threshold`, not `query_input`\r\n\r\nRelated function is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/elizaos/eliza/blob/15f7ba88d04d9d7d1cf0f608762fa84da06cb313/packages/adapter-sqlite/src/index.ts#L332C11-L360\r\n\r\nI'm happy to contribute if someone can guide me. I have little clue about `vec_distance` and didn't manage to infer what the intention of the change was exactly.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"characters/custom.character.json\"` and type something\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo sqlite errors\r\n",
