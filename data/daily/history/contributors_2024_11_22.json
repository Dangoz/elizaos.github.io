This ticket covers initial support for interacting with the Coinbase Commerce API and lays the foundation for extending features to the broader Coinbase SDK.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- **Medium**: Integration with external APIs can introduce potential downtime or unexpected behavior due to changes in the Coinbase Commerce API.\r\n- **Low**: Incorrect API usage or configuration could result in failed requests or unhandled errors affecting the user experience.\r\n- **Medium**: Mismanagement of sensitive API keys could lead to security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a plugin for interacting with the Coinbase Commerce API, enabling the creation of payment charges. It includes:\r\n- **Charge Creation**: Allows users to create charges with parameters like price, currency, name, and description.\r\n- **Fetch All Charges**: Retrieves a list of all charges created via the API.\r\n- **Get Charge Details**: Fetches detailed information for a specific charge using its unique ID.\r\n- Provides a foundation for extending functionality to other Coinbase SDK features (e.g., payments, events).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Feature**: Non-breaking change that adds new functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis integration enables seamless payment handling using Coinbase Commerce, allowing users to:\r\n- Generate crypto-based payment links.\r\n- Fetch and manage charges efficiently.\r\n- Extend payment functionality across Coinbase's ecosystem as the plugin evolves.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- **Yes**: \r\n  - Update the project documentation to include usage instructions for the Coinbase Commerce plugin.\r\n  - Provide details on required API keys, configuration, and example commands for creating and managing charges.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Review the `coinbaseCommercePlugin` implementation in the `plugins` directory.\r\n- Focus on the `createCharge`, `getAllCharges`, and `getChargeDetails` functions to ensure proper API handling and validation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup**:\r\n   - Ensure a valid Coinbase Commerce API key is available.\r\n   - Configure the API key in the plugin's settings.\r\n\r\n2. **Test Charge Creation**:\r\n   - Execute the charge creation action with valid parameters (e.g., price, currency, name, and description).\r\n   - Verify the charge is created successfully and the API response matches expectations.\r\n\r\n3. **Test Fetch All Charges**:\r\n   - Call the fetch-all-charges action.\r\n   - Verify the response includes all previously created charges.\r\n\r\n4. **Test Fetch Charge Details**:\r\n   - Call the get-charge-details action using a valid charge ID.\r\n   - Verify the response contains the expected details for the specified charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GyZlESqB7UL7TL5ti--reaEi2UbpDZa8/view?usp=sharing\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure the environment has the `COINBASE_COMMERCE_KEY` set correctly.\r\n- Verify network access to the Coinbase Commerce API.\r\n- No database changes are required for this feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Deploy the updated plugin files to the production environment.\r\n2. Set the `COINBASE_COMMERCE_KEY` environment variable with a valid API key.\r\n3. Test the integration with the live Coinbase Commerce API to ensure functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n0x8664\r\n\r\n",
