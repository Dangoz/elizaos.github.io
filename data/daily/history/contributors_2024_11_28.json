            "body": "---\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\nEnhance Providers with Wallet History (Transactions and Balances)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow.\r\n- The new functionality fetches and formats wallet balances and transactions. \r\n- Possible risks include:\r\n  - Increased response time for providers due to the added API calls.\r\n  - Dependency on the Coinbase SDK for accurate data retrieval.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR enhances the `massPayoutProvider`, `tradeProvider`, and `chargeProvider` to include wallet balances and recent transactions in their responses. Additionally:\r\n1. A reusable utility function `getWalletDetails` is introduced to:\r\n   - Fetch wallet balances.\r\n   - Retrieve recent wallet transactions.\r\n   - Format and return this data.\r\n2. The `getAssetType` helper function is added to determine the asset type (e.g., ETH, USDC) for transactions.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)**  \r\nThis PR extends existing providers to include wallet details, making them more informative and versatile.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis enhancement allows users to:\r\n- View current wallet balances alongside provider data (e.g., payouts, trades, or charges).\r\n- Understand recent wallet activity, including transaction timestamps, asset types, and statuses.\r\nThe goal is to provide a unified source of wallet-related insights within each provider.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes.  \r\nThe functionality of the affected providers now includes wallet details. The documentation should reflect:\r\n1. Input parameters: No changes required.\r\n2. Output: Providers now return wallet balances and recent transactions in addition to their existing data.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the `getWalletDetails` function in `utils.ts` for implementation details.\r\n2. Check the updated `massPayoutProvider`, `tradeProvider`, and `chargeProvider` for integration of wallet details.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure the Coinbase SDK with a valid wallet and network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet).\r\n2. Call the following providers:\r\n   - `massPayoutProvider.get()`\r\n   - `tradeProvider.get()`\r\n   - `chargeProvider.get()`\r\n3. Verify:\r\n   - Balances include correct asset types and amounts.\r\n   - Transactions include valid timestamps, asset types, statuses, and URLs.\r\n   - Original provider data (e.g., CSV records, charges, or trades) remains unaffected.\r\n4. Test scenarios with:\r\n   - Wallets containing no balances or transactions.\r\n   - Wallets with multiple assets.\r\n5. Edge cases:\r\n   - Unsupported networks or invalid wallet configurations.\r\n   - Handling of unknown token types in `getAssetType`.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n**`massPayoutProvider` Output:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"csvRecords\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"address\": \"0x123...\",\r\n      \"amount\": 0.01,\r\n      \"status\": \"Success\",\r\n      \"errorCode\": \"\",\r\n      \"transactionUrl\": \"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x...\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n**`massPayoutProvider` Output:**\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"csvRecords\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"address\": \"0x123...\",\r\n      \"amount\": 0.01,\r\n      \"status\": \"Success\",\r\n      \"errorCode\": \"\",\r\n      \"transactionUrl\": \"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x...\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"balances\": [\r\n    { \"asset\": \"ETH\", \"amount\": \"1.23\" },\r\n    { \"asset\": \"USDC\", \"amount\": \"500.45\" }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"transactionHistory\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"timestamp\": \"2024-11-26T14:15:22Z\",\r\n      \"amount\": \"100\",\r\n      \"asset\": \"USDC\",\r\n      \"status\": \"Completed\",\r\n      \"transactionUrl\": \"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x...\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1546\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-28 at 2 13 08\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a57ce6c-a08c-4a44-8aae-51e93b1c516d\">\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps are required.

This becomes limiting when a provider excels at text generation but offers subpar image generation capabilities, or vice versa.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe propose adding an optional image model provider setting that would take precedence over the default model provider when configured. If no image provider is specified, the system would continue using the default model provider, maintaining backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nWe've explored using a single provider (such as Heurist or OpenAI) for both text and image generation. While this works adequately, it limits flexibility. For instance, if you want to use a fine-tuned model from a specialized image generation service, this isn't currently possible.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI've implemented a similar solution that allows me to use OpenAI for text generation while leveraging a custom fine-tuned model on fal.ai for image generation.\r\n",
