Key updates include:  \r\n1. Parsing `transferTemplate` details to dynamically construct transactions for processing.  \r\n2. Validating input parameters (e.g., `receivingAddresses`, `network`) to ensure they comply with supported formats and networks.  \r\n3. Appending all processed transactions (successes and failures) to a CSV file dynamically created in `src/plugins/transactions.csv`.  \r\n4. Generating wallet details dynamically if not already present.  \r\n5. If a wallet is not pre-configured:\r\n   - A new wallet is generated and saved to `characters/charactername.character.json` under `settings.secrets`.\r\n   - If the character file does not exist, the wallet details are saved to a `character-seed.txt` file, and a note is added to move these details manually to the character's settings or environment variables.  \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Improvements:** Adds dynamic appending and parsing of CSV data.  \r\n**Features:** Introduces mass payouts using Coinbase SDK for supported networks.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n**Yes.** The changes require an update to project documentation to reflect:  \r\n1. New `transferTemplate` structure for mass payouts.  \r\n2. Supported networks (`base`, `sol`, `eth`, `arb`, `pol`).  \r\n3. Steps to validate environment variables for `COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.  \r\n4. Guidance for handling dynamically generated wallets (e.g., adding details from `character-seed.txt` to `settings.secrets` or `.env`).  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `massPayoutProvider.get` function for dynamic parsing and handling of CSV records.  \r\n2. `executeMassPayout` logic for sequential processing of transactions.  \r\n3. Integration of Coinbase SDK for wallet initialization and balance checks.  \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables:**  \r\n   - Ensure `COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` are set in the `.env` file or runtime settings.  \r\n\r\n2. **Process Mass Payout Transactions:**  \r\n   - Execute a payout request using the `SEND_MASS_PAYOUT` action.  \r\n   - Validate successful transactions are logged in the CSV file.  \r\n\r\n3. **Wallet Generation:**  \r\n   - Remove `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED` and `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID` from your configuration.  \r\n   - Verify that a new wallet is created and stored in `characters/charactername.character.json` under `settings.secrets`.  \r\n   - If the character file does not exist, confirm that the wallet details are written to `charactername-seed.txt` with instructions to move them manually.  \r\n\r\n4. **Validate Edge Cases:**  \r\n   - Process invalid addresses.  \r\n   - Handle insufficient wallet balances.  \r\n   - Verify proper CSV appending and transaction updates.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/160rreXAoKBj9db8lIMjF5LW8EmAihQmi/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### After  \r\n- Dynamic CSV appending:  \r\n```csv\r\nAddress,Amount,Status,Error Code,Transaction URL\r\n0xA0ba2ACB5846A54834173fB0DD9444F756810f06,0.0001,Success,,https://basescan.org/tx/0x420332...\r\n0xF14F2c49aa90BaFA223EE074C1C33b59891826bF,0.0001,Failed,Insufficient Funds,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Screen Recording**: \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Verify CSV file path in `src/plugins/transactions.csv` is accessible.  \r\n- Ensure wallet initialization works seamlessly for networks without pre-generated wallet details.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- None.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n1.

This PR modifies an existing Farcaster client PR to use Neynar instead of a direct hub. This makes it easier for people to deploy hubs and makes it easier to add additional features in the future using Neynar's APIs for interacting with Farcaster data.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

I am going through the documentation and following it but when I am faced with the problem, I have to check for the issues or add new issues in the GitHub. There is no way for me to validate if I'm doing something wrong or if it is a bug in the framework. Needing to have all discussions on the GitHub issues slows down the overall learning and development of the framework in my opinion. Group can be used to do preliminary discussions and then issues can be added if necessary. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nStart a discord server and Telegram Group chat to provide support and have preliminary discussions on the issues. This will make the framework more user-friendly to new developers like me.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI have considered going through the issues, searching there and adding new issues but in my opinion, it's can pollute the issues with common issues, beginner mistakes etc.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNo context. I think what I have answered in previous questions provides sufficient context for the issue. \r\n",
