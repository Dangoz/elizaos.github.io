Also cleans up some of the Starknet plugin code.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeature + refactor.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThe old Starknet walletProvider.ts was based on the Solana one, but wasn't fully functioning. This new one is. \r\n\r\nBecause there's no free API that returns the whole portfolio of a wallet for Starknet, I'm using a whitelist of tokens (`PORTFOLIO_TOKENS`) and Coingecko API to get the USD prices. An alternative would be to use BlastAPI's [Builder API -> getWalletTokenBalances](https://docs.blastapi.io/blast-documentation/apis-documentation/builder-api/starknet/wallet/getwallettokenbalances) but that would require additional setup (Blast API key).\r\n\r\nThe output of the new plugin is sth like this:\r\n```text\r\nsymbol  | balance              | USD value\r\n==================================================\r\nETH      | 0.059468702404375927| 207.55\r\nSTRK     | 120                 | 72.62\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNone that I'm aware of since there's no docs for this plugin.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNone, automtated tests are fine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/elizaos and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n`milan3774`\r\n",
