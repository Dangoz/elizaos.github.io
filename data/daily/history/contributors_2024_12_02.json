Here's the sequence:\r\n\r\n1. First call:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then the callback is passed to `processActions`:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    callback  // <-- Same callback passed here\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Inside `processActions`, the action handler might call the callback again:\r\n```typescript\r\nawait action.handler(this, message, state, {}, callback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you could:\r\n\r\n1. Either modify the callback to be single-use:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst createCallback = () => {\r\n    let used = false;\r\n    return async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n        if (used) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Callback already used, skipping\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        used = true;\r\n        // ... rest of callback logic ...\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst callback = createCallback();\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Or create separate callbacks for the initial response and actions:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nconst responseMessages = await callback(responseContent);\r\n\r\n// Create a new callback for actions that doesn't create memories\r\nconst actionCallback: HandlerCallback = async (content: Content, files: any[]) => {\r\n    try {\r\n        if (!content?.text.trim()) {\r\n            elizaLogger.warn(\"Skipping empty content\");\r\n            return [];\r\n        }\r\n        return await sendMessageInChunks(\r\n            message.channel as TextChannel,\r\n            content.text,\r\n            message.id,\r\n            files\r\n        );\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n        console.error(\"Error in action callback:\", error);\r\n        return [];\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nawait this.runtime.processActions(\r\n    memory,\r\n    responseMessages,\r\n    state,\r\n    actionCallback\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second approach might be better as it makes the distinction between response handling and action handling clearer.\r\n"

Run the application locally without the `non-interactive` flag and verify that `chat()` runs as expected.\r\n2. Run the application locally with the `non-interactive` flag and confirm it bypasses `chat()` and does not wait for user input.\r\n3.

While the build system improvements work as expected, the type error in the postgres adapter could affect database operations that rely on embedding configurations. (see next)\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Changed the 'dev' script in package.json to use 'turbo run dev --parallel --no-cache' for better performance\r\n- Updated turbo.json to streamline task dependencies and outputs for the 'dev' and 'build' tasks\r\n- Modified agent/package.json to point the main entry to 'dist/index.js' and adjusted scripts for building and starting the application\r\n- Enhanced core/package.json 'dev' script to specify the source file for watching during development\r\n\r\nHowever, during testing I discovered a type error that needs to be addressed in some future PR:\r\n\r\n```Module '\"@elizaos/eliza\"' has no exported member 'getEmbeddingConfig'.```\r\n\r\nThis error appears in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` when trying to import `getEmbeddingConfig` from the core package.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nSee [pnpm run dev does not work out of the box #780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/780)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Run `pnpm i`\r\n2. Run `pnpm run dev`\r\n3. Verify that all packages start building in watch mode\r\n4. Note the type error in the postgres adapter that needs to be fixed in a follow-up PR\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Check that turbo correctly runs builds in parallel\r\n2. Verify that file changes trigger rebuilds appropriately\r\n3. Confirm that the build dependencies are working (core package builds before dependent packages)\r\n4. Note the type error in postgres adapter needs fixing:\r\n   - File: `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts`\r\n   - Error: `Module '\"@elizaos/eliza\"' has no exported member 'getEmbeddingConfig'`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nThe type error in the postgres adapter should be fixed before deploying to prod/new release. The build system changes themselves are ready for deployment.",
