List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nCurrently the Solana and EVM Plugin are not aware of the TEE Plugin and a lot of custom code and configuration must be done to add deployment of Eliza agents in a TEE. This PR solves this issue by making the TEE Plugin an opt-in feature that allows developers to build a TEE compatible Eliza Agent to deploy in a Intel TDX Server running the Dstack SDK.\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new env variable called `TEE_MODE` with values of `OFF`, `LOCAL`, `DOCKER`, `PRODUCTION`. When the  `TEE_MODE` is set to an option other than `OFF` or `undefined` then the agent will utilize the TEE Plugin to handle wallet generations for the Solana Plugin.\r\n\r\nEvery time a key is derived to generate a wallet in the Solana Plugin the following happens:\r\n- Derives an ed25519 key based on the value of the `WALLET_SECRET_SALT`\r\n- Generates a Remote Attestation Quote with the `reportdata` that includes a JSON string of `{agentId: ${agentId}, publicKey: ${publicKey}}`\r\n- In the logs, a user can take the RA Quote and the `reportdata` to verify publicly at https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ \r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeature\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. There will be another step in this PR to add documentation within the advanced section to step developers through setting up their Eliza Agent to be TEE compatible. This documentation will take developers through the process of\r\n- Building an Agent locally with TEE_MODE enabled\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a locally deployed Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a docker container of the Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the Eliza Agent within a Real TEE via Phala Network's Dstack Dashboard\r\n- How to verify a Remote Attestation on https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ and validate the `reportdata` passed into the RA Quote\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nRun through existing Solana Plugin tests before merge.\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA reviewer should start by running the existing codebase with `TEE_MODE` set to `OFF` to ensure functionality hasn't broken.\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Run existing test sets that have TEE_MODE set `OFF` or `undefined` and pass all tests\r\n- Set `TEE_MODE` to `LOCAL` and run through a local test by launching the docker TEE Simulator then building and starting the project on the development machine where the docker TEE Simulator is running \r\n- Set `TEE_MODE` to `DOCKER` and run through a docker test by launching the docker TEE Simulator then building a docker image on a `linux/amd64` platform where the docker TEE Simulator is running\r\n- (Optional: I can record a start from scratch video) Set `TEE_MODE` to `PRODUCTION` and run through a production deployment by launching in an Intel TDX Server with Dstack SDK setup to deploy via a dashboard\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nAsk Eliza Agent about their wallet info\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73a624d8-8e98-4729-bc94-a54c5cc7ee81)\r\n\r\nGenerate RA Quote with reportdata of AgentID + Derived Solana Pub Key\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ba234b-2abb-4a03-81c4-a7ffd2efb1d1)\r\n\r\nVerify in the TEE RA Explorer (This is a simulator so is should say unverified, but we can still validate the `rtmr`s\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ef6407-b243-4d4a-a69f-b6c1bc5ac31c)\r\n\r\nVerify the `rtmr`s in the quote\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/192179bc-5d19-4b77-b004-332f4371766b)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/elizaos and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

Does converting to this standard protocol enhance that at all? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBased on the extensive MCP documentation provided, here are some hypothetical benefits of integrating MCP into this codebase:\r\n\r\n1. **Standardized AI-System Communication**\r\n    - The codebase could leverage MCP's standardized protocol for communication between the AI (Claude) and various system resources\r\n    - This would provide a more structured and secure way to handle interactions compared to custom implementations\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**\r\n    - MCP's resource system could help manage character files and data in a standardized way\r\n    - Characters could be exposed as MCP resources with proper MIME types and metadata\r\n    - Real-time updates to character data could leverage MCP's resource subscription system\r\n\r\n3. **Tool Integration**\r\n    - MCP tools could provide standardized ways to:\r\n      - Read/write character files\r\n      - Validate character data\r\n      - Perform character-related operations\r\n      - Handle file system operations securely\r\n    - Tools could be exposed with clear schemas and descriptions for the AI to understand\r\n\r\n4. **Security Benefits**\r\n    - MCP's security model would provide better isolation and control over what the AI can access\r\n    - Built-in validation and sanitization of inputs\r\n    - Controlled access to file system and other resources\r\n    - Clear error handling patterns\r\n\r\n5. **Development Benefits**\r\n    - Better debugging capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Standardized logging and error reporting\r\n    - Clear separation between AI capabilities and system operations\r\n    - Type safety through SDK integrations\r\n    - Built-in progress reporting for long operations\r\n\r\n6. **Extensibility**\r\n    - Easy addition of new capabilities through MCP servers\r\n    - Potential to integrate with other tools and services\r\n    - Standardized way to add new features that interact with the AI\r\n\r\n7. **Testing & Maintenance**\r\n    - Better testing capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Clear protocol specifications make maintenance easier\r\n    - Standard patterns for error handling and logging\r\n    - Built-in tools for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\nThis would represent a shift from custom implementations to a standardized protocol, potentially making the codebase more maintainable and extensible while improving security and reliability.\r\n"

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A - Improvement to model selection functionality\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect how model class is selected, with fallback to default values\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nUpdates model class selection to respect character configuration settings instead of using hardcoded values. This allows characters to use different model sizes without code changes.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix (allows existing config file settings to be implemented as indicated in the [documentation](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/guides/configuration/#model-providers))\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nChanges to code line references and a README note for Apple Silicon users\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFiles changed:\r\n1. `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in direct message handling\r\n2. `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts` - Updated model selection in Discord message handling\r\n3. `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in Telegram message handling\r\n4. `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts` - Updated model selection in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n5. `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts` - Updated model selection in continue action\r\n\r\nThe key change in each file is replacing hardcoded `ModelClass.SMALL` with:\r\n````typescript\r\nmodelClass: runtime.character.settings?.model || ModelClass.SMALL,\r\n````\r\nThis ensures consistent model selection across all client types while maintaining the small model as a fallback.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a character config with model setting:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"model\": \"medium\",\r\n        \"temperature\": 0.45\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start agent with character config:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --character=\"path/to/character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify in logs that responses use the configured model:\r\n```\r\nGenerating text with options: \r\n{\"modelProvider\":\"openai\",\"model\":\"medium\"}\r\n\r\nSelected model: \r\ngpt-4o\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Test with different model settings (\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\") to verify proper model selection\r\n\r\nFiles changed:\r\n- `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in direct message handling\r\n- `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Discord message handling\r\n- `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-telegram/src/messageManager.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Telegram message handling\r\n- `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n- `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts`\r\n  - Modified model selection in CONTINUE action to use character settings\r\n  - Updated both `generateMessageResponse()` and `generateTrueOrFalse()` calls\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard build process:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo database changes or special deployment instructions needed.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@seanbhart\r\n",
