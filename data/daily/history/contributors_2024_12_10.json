This\r\neliminates the need for a separate .gitignore file in the agent/ folder.\r\n\r\n2- I have corrected the hardcoded path issue by replacing it with a\r\nrelative path using __dirname for better portability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n3-I understand the concern about deleting sample characters. To test our\r\nsports analysis functionality, I temporarily replaced the sample character\r\nfile but have since reverted it back.

I'd like to improve the `state` to also take into account memories and previous messages so that the user can have a conversation with the agent, instead of having to pass all the information on one message. The thing is that when I've passed the whole `state` I got answers that were really related to the personality of the `character`, and I got answers that refused to help like \"I'm not here to do that\". \r\nHow can I incorporate the `state`'s memory without the personality of the `character` to gather the parameters for my `action`?"

            "body": "Here's a PR description for the EVM plugin changes:\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly enhances the EVM plugin functionality with several key improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Added core ERC-20 functionality:\r\n   - Added ERC-20 ABI and contract interactions\r\n   - Implemented token balance checking\r\n   - Added support for token transfers\r\n\r\n2. Implemented new actions:\r\n   - `getBalance`: Check ETH/token balances across chains\r\n   - `transfer`: Native token and ERC-20 transfers\r\n   - Enhanced `bridge`: Cross-chain token bridging via LiFi\r\n   - Enhanced `swap`: DEX token swaps \r\n   - via LiFi aggregation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"745\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 7 10 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6ad6ba-6338-43d9-a234-5059f3fa144c\">\r\n\r\n3. Fixed type safety issues and improved error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core wallet functionality could impact transaction signing\r\n- Updates to bridge/swap logic could affect cross-chain operations\r\n- ERC-20 integration adds complexity to token handling\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the core changes in:\r\n   - `src/actions/bridge.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/swap.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/transfer.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/getbalance.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Check test implementation:\r\n   - `test/setup.ts` - Test infrastructure\r\n   - `test/actions/bridge.test.ts` - Bridge action tests\r\n   - `test/providers/wallet.test.ts` - Wallet provider tests\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test basic ETH operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n\r\n// Transfer ETH\r\nawait transferAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test ERC-20 operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check USDC balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  chain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Bridge tokens\r\nawait bridgeAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  fromChain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  toChain: \"base\",\r\n  amount: \"100\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation updates needed for:\r\n- New ERC-20 functionality\r\n- Updated action parameters\r\n- Testing setup and mocking\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Requires environment variables:\r\n  - `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (optional, for token verification)\r\n- Dependencies on LiFi SDK and viem need to be properly versioned\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to: #735",
