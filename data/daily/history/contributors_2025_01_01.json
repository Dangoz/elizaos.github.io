Which on subsequent messages, would trigger the callback to respond to the same message multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhere the continue action is meant for a natural flow of thoughts to keep generating, on normal back and forth convo's it would duplicate response.\r\n\r\nFix below now stops that as it takes into consideration its own message it just responded to, and how it framed to either not respond again, or continue a thought as it was intended.\r\n\r\n---TESTING Screen Record---\r\n1st section shows a previous double response, which is triggered by the question the agent asked to the user, which in turn triggers a double response on the next reply from the user\r\n\r\n2nd section shows continue being triggered as normal, but not triggering another response in the handler callback since it already responded. This will still allow continue to allow the agent to \"continue\" a thought it had as it was intended, also, per the examples.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed92c8f-dc99-4c3b-95fc-9c0052f56197\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nninja_dev\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",
