Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
