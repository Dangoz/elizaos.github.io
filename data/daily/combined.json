Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.

The embedded video by Nader Dabit [How to Build a Social AI Agent in 15 minutes with X, Telegram, Onchain Capabilities | Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZVwNTl5hI&ab_channel=NaderDabit) seems to be outdated. \n2. The textual description below the video, to setup the Twitter Agent, doesn't follow the video and it's outdated as well. \n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Follow the video and check if it works\n2. Follow the description below the video and check if it works\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA tutorial that let developer to build a Social Agent in 15 minutes\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI'm happy to help to fix it, but I'm still working my way through the documentation to understand how to implement the Twitter/X agent. \n\n---\n\nWhat is also a little bit confusing is that in the docs Twitter is described as a Client ...\n\n<img width=\"857\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd2147a8-707b-4fbe-bd9f-d75934e4239c\" />\n\n\n... but the link brings us to the repo plugins/twitter-client ...\n\n\n<img width=\"1314\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5e22f87-bb2d-4f59-b3de-81af1b80015b\" />\n\nSo apparently some of the plugins are clients but not all plugins are client. \n\n---\n\nThe doc for the plugins page seems also to be outdated since it uses the package `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, that probably doesn't exist anymore. \n\n<img width=\"874\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cef0e85-2561-416a-b992-9644d3fdc446\" />\n\n---\n\nIn the README of the twitter plugin, this snippet is suggested for installation but it's not clear in which file it should be places. I suppose in `src/index.ts` \n\n<img width=\"932\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42784a1e-f6d7-48c9-a6f9-90112eb99b5e\" />\n\n---\n\n### **Nader Dabit** approach\n\nNadir is creating a new file `mainCharacter` file in `/agent/src` https://github.com/dabit3/ai-agent-cognitivedriftt/blob/main/agent/src/mainCharacter.ts. \n```\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"@ai16z/eliza\";\nimport { defaultCharacter } from './defaultCharacter.ts'\n\nexport const mainCharacter: Character = {\n    ...defaultCharacter,\n    clients: [Clients.TWITTER],\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.CLAUDE_VERTEX,\n    name: \"cognitivedriftt\",\n}\n```\n1. Eliza has been moved from `@ai16z/eliza`\n2. The Twitter Client is an autonomous plugin now. So ` clients: [Clients.TWITTER],` is not valid anymore. \n\n### Approach in the description below the video\n\n```\nimport { DefaultCharacter } from \"./defaultCharacter\";\nimport { clients } from \"../globalClients\";\n\nexport const mainCharacter = {\n    ...DefaultCharacter,\n    clients: { twitter: clients.twitter },\n    modelProvider: modelProviders.anthropic,\n};\n```\n\nThe `globalClinets` file doesn't exist anymore anywhere in the Eliza repo and it doesn't seem to fit the way we are supposed to integrate the Twitter Plugin/Client as described in the README of https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/client-twitter",
