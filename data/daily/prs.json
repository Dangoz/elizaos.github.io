    "body": "## Fix Telegram negative chat ID UUID conversion\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nTelegram group chat IDs are often negative numbers (starting with `-`), which causes issues when converting to UUIDs with `createUniqueUuid()`. This has been causing world creation to fail because the generated IDs aren't recognized as valid UUIDs.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nModified the code to properly handle negative Telegram chat IDs by removing the negative sign before UUID creation while still maintaining uniqueness. This ensures chat IDs like `-12345679909866` are properly converted to valid UUIDs.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Updated `handleNewChat` method to sanitize chat IDs before UUID creation\r\n- Applied the same fix to the `setupEntityTracking` method\r\n- Maintains unique identifier mapping while ensuring UUID validity",
