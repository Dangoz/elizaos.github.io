Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.

Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Adding a patch to handle CommonJS/ESM module compatibility\r\n2. Updating import syntax to use default import with destructuring\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Resolves CommonJS/ESM module compatibility error\r\n- Maintains existing functionality\r\n- Improves build reliability\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Check the patch file: `patches/@solana-developers__helpers.patch`\r\n2. Verify the import changes in `transaction.js`\r\n3. Run `pnpm install` to confirm the patch applies correctly\r\n4. Run `pnpm build` to verify the ESM error is resolved\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`\r\n3. Build the project: `pnpm build`\r\n4. Verify no ESM import errors from @coral-xyz/anchor\r\n\r\nThe patch converts:\r\n```javascript\r\n// From\r\nimport { Program, ... } from \"@coral-xyz/anchor\";\r\n\r\n// To\r\nimport pkg from '@coral-xyz/anchor';\r\nconst { Program, ... } = pkg;\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nPatch will be automatically applied during installation via pnpm's patching system.",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Updated RPC method calls to match new API structure:\r\n   - Changed `getTokenAccountsByOwner` to use new parameter format\r\n   - Added proper commitment level configurations\r\n   - Updated response handling to match new data structures\r\n\r\n3. Improved type safety:\r\n   - Using proper Address types from new SDK\r\n   - Added explicit type assertions where needed\r\n   - Properly handling lamports conversion\r\n\r\nThese changes align with the new Solana SDK architecture while maintaining existing functionality.

Please describe.**\n\nThe current codebase lacks consistent coding standards, which makes it difficult for new developers to onboard and contributes to potential bugs and maintainability issues.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement standardized coding practices across the project. This includes:\n- Establishing naming conventions for variables and functions.\n- Enforcing consistent indentation and formatting.\n- Utilizing automated tools like ESLint for JavaScript or Prettier for formatting.\n- Creating a style guide that outlines best practices for writing code.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nCurrently relying on individual developer preferences, which leads to inconsistencies and confusion.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nAdopting standardized coding practices will improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.\n\n**Related Issues/PRs**\n- [Issue #123](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/123) - Previous discussions on coding standards.",

It includes:\r\n\r\n- Implementation of DeFAI service interfaces for protocol-agnostic AI interactions\r\n- Automated translation of human language into protocol-specific actions (e.g., swapping, bridging, staking)\r\n- Support for various DeFi protocols, including smart contract interaction and transaction execution\r\n- A blockchain-agnostic architecture that enables flexible and scalable integrations\r\n- Secure execution of AI-driven DeFi operations within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), powered by Phala Network\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user requests to bridge assets on LayerSwap, DeFAI Protocol will generate a structured JSON representation containing the necessary parameters, such as action type, network details, input/output tokens, amount, and recipient address. This ensures accurate and efficient execution of DeFi transactions by AI agents.\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)\r\n\r\n- Enhances AI agent capabilities with natural language to DeFi action translation\r\n- Introduces a structured framework for DeFi interactions\r\n- Ensures secure, confidential execution of AI-driven DeFi transactions using Phala Network\u2019s TEE infrastructure\r\n- Enables AI-driven DeFi transactions and smart contract interactions\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
