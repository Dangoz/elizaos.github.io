    "title": "Message id collision in Telegram Client",
    "body": "**Describe the bug**  \nThe `msg_id` and `agent_id` are used to create a UUID for messages, leading to potential collisions:  \n\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/227baf7bd62394a50ae261e934669e4a9520b87f/packages/client-telegram/src/messageManager.ts#L1266C2-L1268C23\n\n```typescript\nconst messageId = stringToUuid(message.message_id.toString() + \"-\" + this.runtime.agentId) as UUID;\n```\n\nIf the same `msg_id` is used in a different channel, the agent incorrectly assumes the memory already exists and skips creating a new memory:  \n\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/227baf7bd62394a50ae261e934669e4a9520b87f/packages/core/src/memory.ts#L172C1-L190C6\n\n```typescript\nasync createMemory(memory: Memory, unique = false): Promise<void> {\n    // TODO: check memory.agentId == this.runtime.agentId\n\n    const existingMessage =\n        await this.runtime.databaseAdapter.getMemoryById(memory.id);\n\n    if (existingMessage) {\n        elizaLogger.debug(\"Memory already exists, skipping\");\n        return;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**  \n1. Use the same `msg_id` in a different chat or channel (e.g., in Telegram).  \n2. Attempt to create a memory for the new message.  \n3. Observe that the memory creation is skipped due to the `msg_id` collision.  \n\n**Expected behavior**  \nMemory creation should account for different channels or rooms. The system should generate a unique `UUID` by including the `room_id` in the `msg_id` creation process to avoid collisions.  \n\n**Screenshots**  \n\nWe encountered an issue in Telegram where the message already existed for a different user.\n\n### A log before memory creation:\n\n<img width=\"1091\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c659c325-55aa-424e-aa68-2423754229b0\" />\n\n### It's clearly visible that even with the same message ID, the room and user are different:\n\n<img width=\"860\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d2a1e1f-a56a-4bbd-851c-e9fcd08d5fbc\" />\n\n**Suggested solution**    \nA potential solution would be updating the UUID creation logic to replace `agent_id ` with `room_id` in addition to `msg_id` becuase `room_id` is generated based on `agent_id` already. However, further research is needed to confirm whether collisions involving `room_id` are possible.  \n\nAlso further investigation is needed to verify if collisions are possible in other clients.",
