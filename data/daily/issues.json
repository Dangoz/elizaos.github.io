    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nThe current database implementation uses raw SQL queries which can be cumbersome to maintain and test. Adding a Sequelize client option would provide developers with a more familiar and maintainable ORM-based approach while keeping the existing PostgreSQL adapter intact.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd a new `SequelizeDatabaseClient` class that implements the existing `DatabaseAdapter` interface using Sequelize ORM. This would provide:\n\n- Model-based database operations instead of raw SQL\n- Built-in connection pooling and transaction management  \n- Better TypeScript integration through Sequelize models\n- Easier testing through Sequelize's test helpers\n- Optional alternative to the current PostgreSQL adapter\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n- TypeORM: Less robust PostgreSQL support\n- Prisma: Requires additional build steps \n- Knex.js: Only query builder without ORM features\n- Keeping only raw SQL: Less maintainable long-term\n\n**Additional context**\nThis would be an additive feature - the existing PostgreSQL adapter would remain untouched and developers could choose which implementation to use. The Sequelize client would follow the same interface and maintain compatibility with all current features including vector operations.",

    "body": "Hi,  \n\nWhile trying to integrate `elizaos/core` into my project, I encountered the following issues:  \n\n1. **ESM-related Problems**  \n   - During testing with both JavaScript and TypeScript, I faced challenges due to ESM compatibility.  \n   - For instance, the need to set `\"type\": \"module\"` in `package.json` wasn't clearly mentioned, which caused some confusion.  \n\n2. **Required Dependencies**  \n   - Packages like `sharp`, `dotenv`, and `@tavily/core` had to be installed separately to make the project work.  \n   - These dependencies were not mentioned in the documentation, leading to initial setup difficulties.  \n\nTo address these issues, it would be helpful to have a simple guide covering the following points:  \n- **Basic Configuration**  \n  - What needs to be added to `package.json` (e.g., `\"type\": \"module\"`)  \n- **Recommended TypeScript Settings**  \n  - Suggested `tsconfig.json` configuration  \n- **Required Dependencies**  \n  - A list of dependencies necessary for the project to run  \n\nA beginner-friendly guide with clear instructions for the initial setup would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nThank you!
