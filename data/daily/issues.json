    "title": "@elizaos/plugin-tee-log@0.1.8 has incorrect workspace dependency reference",
    "body": "**Describe the bug**\nInstallation fails when using pnpm due to an incorrect workspace dependency reference in `@elizaos/plugin-tee-log@0.1.8`. The package incorrectly references `@elizaos/core` using a workspace protocol (`workspace:*`) instead of a proper version number.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Create a new project\n2. Add the following to package.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@elizaos/adapter-supabase\": \"0.1.8\",\n    \"@elizaos/client-discord\": \"0.1.8\",\n    \"@elizaos/client-direct\": \"0.1.8\",\n    \"@elizaos/core\": \"0.1.8\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap\": \"0.1.8\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-node\": \"0.1.8\"\n  }\n}\n```\n3. Run `pnpm install`\n4. Observe the error:\n```bash\nERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND  In : \"@elizaos/core@workspace:*\" is in the dependencies but no package named \"@elizaos/core\" is present in the workspace\n\nThis error happened while installing the dependencies of @elizaos/client-direct@0.1.8\n at @elizaos/plugin-tee-log@0.1.8\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe package should install successfully using pnpm. The `@elizaos/plugin-tee-log` package should reference `@elizaos/core` using a proper version number (e.g. \"0.1.8\") instead of using workspace protocol.\n\n**Additional context**\n- Error occurs in `@elizaos/plugin-tee-log@0.1.8` which is a dependency of `@elizaos/client-direct@0.1.8`\n- Attempted workarounds:\n  - Using different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)\n  - Configuring .npmrc with various workspace settings\n  - Trying to disable workspace protocol resolution\n- Using yarn instead of pnpm appears to work around the issue\n- Environment:\n  - OS: macOS 21.6.0\n  - Package Manager: pnpm\n  - Node.js version: [22.13.1]\n```\n",

I followed the same model as [the weather plugin example](packages/plugin-open-weather/src/examples.ts) for my `example.ts` \n\nIt seems that there is no easy way to do this and I think it should be done.
