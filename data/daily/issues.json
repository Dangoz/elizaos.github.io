    "title": "Twitter Plugin: Duplicate Memory Creation on Mentions & Null Post Interval Configuration",
    "body": "# ElizaOS Twitter Plugin Bugs\n\n## Issue 1: Duplicate Key Error When Receiving Twitter Mentions\n\n**Describe the bug**\nWhen someone mentions the bot on Twitter, the system tries to create a memory record twice with the same ID, resulting in database errors:\n\n```\nerror: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"memories_pkey\"\ndetail: \"Key (id)=(d79a6e52-7b78-0c8b-941d-fd9c0e353f7a) already exists.\"\n```\n\nLogs show the same memory ID being processed twice:\n```\n[2025-03-30 05:29:29] DEBUG: DrizzleAdapter createMemory:\n    memoryId: \"d79a6e52-7b78-0c8b-941d-fd9c0e353f7a\"\n    contentLength: 26\n[2025-03-30 05:29:29] LOG: Processing Tweet: 1906217138978697554\n[2025-03-30 05:29:29] DEBUG: DrizzleAdapter createMemory:\n    memoryId: \"d79a6e52-7b78-0c8b-941d-fd9c0e353f7a\"\n    contentLength: 26\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Configure Twitter plugin with valid credentials\n2. Have someone mention your Twitter bot\n3. Check logs for duplicate key errors\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe bot should create only one memory record per tweet mention and handle all interactions without database errors.\n\n**Root cause**\nThe issue occurs because `handleTwitterInteractions()` creates a memory record and then calls `handleTweet()` which tries to create the same memory again:\n1. First creation in `handleTwitterInteractions()` around line 227\n2. Second creation in `handleTweet()` around line 642\n\n## Issue 2: Null Post Interval Configuration\n\n**Describe the bug**\nThe Twitter post interval configuration is not being properly read, resulting in null values in the logs:\n\n```\n[2025-03-30 05:31:09] LOG: - Post Interval: null-null minutes\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Configure Twitter plugin with a valid post interval setting\n2. Check logs to see that the interval is showing as null-null minutes\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe logs should correctly show the configured post interval, such as \"Post Interval: 30-60 minutes\" if configured with those values.\n\n**Additional context**\nThe post interval configuration appears to be properly set in the config files, but the system is not reading or applying these values correctly. This may affect the bot's posting schedule.\n\nThese two bugs should be fixed separately as they affect different aspects of the Twitter plugin functionality:\n1. The duplicate key error prevents proper handling of mentions\n2. The null post interval may cause irregular posting behavior ",
