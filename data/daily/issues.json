When a target user tweets a single tweet, my account responds automatically, which works fine. However, when the target user posts a thread (usually containing more than 5 tweets), my account fails to reply. I’ve tried restarting the Eliza service immediately after the target user posts a thread, and sometimes the automatic reply works, but not every time.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nI would like the service to consistently respond to a user's tweet thread just like it does with single tweets, without the need to restart the service.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nI’ve tried adjusting the `TWITTER_POLL_INTERVAL` and other configuration options, but the issue persists. Restarting the service sometimes works but isn't reliable.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nMy current configuration is:\n```\nTWITTER_POLL_INTERVAL=3600\nTWITTER_TARGET_USERS=twitter_user1,twitter_user2,twitter_user3,twitter_user4,twitter_user5,twitter_user6\n```\n",
