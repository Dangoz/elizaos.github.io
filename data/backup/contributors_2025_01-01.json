The implementation provides a reusable and scalable solution for caching data in the application by also implementing the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n\r\n**Implemented Features:**\r\n- `getCache`: Retrieves cached data for a given `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `setCache`: Caches data with a unique key constructed using `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- `deleteCache`: Removes cached data for the specified `agentId` and `key`.\r\n- Proper error handling and logging for all Redis operations.\r\n- Integration with the `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` interface.\r\n\r\n**Code Highlights:**\r\n- A new `RedisClient` class implements the IDatabaseCacheAdapter interface.\r\n- The `buildKey` method ensures unique Redis keys for each agent and operation.\r\n- `ioredis` is used for efficient Redis interactions, supporting advanced Redis features like clusters and pipelines if needed in the future.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Provides a scalable and reusable caching solution.\r\n- Ensures clear separation of concerns and adheres to the existing interface.\r\n- Improves application performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe implementation has been tested for the following scenarios:\r\n- Successfully setting a cache entry.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that exists.\r\n- Retrieving a cache entry that does not exist.\r\n- Deleting a cache entry.\r\n- Handling Redis errors gracefully during operations.\r\n",

Potential risks include:\r\n\r\n- **Dependency Resolution Changes:** Updates might lead to different versions of dependencies being installed, which could introduce unforeseen issues.\r\n\r\n- **Build or Runtime Errors:** If updated dependencies have breaking changes, they might cause build failures or runtime errors.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file by running `pnpm install -r --no-frozen-lockfile`. This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments. This is particularly important when dependencies have been added, removed, or updated in the `package.json` files.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"285\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-01 at 12 18 56\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5421a78e-b3ec-4234-b494-c431e576087a\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the changes in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to understand the updates to dependency resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. **Clean Install:** Run `pnpm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed correctly with the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n2. **Run Tests:** Execute the test suite using `pnpm test` to verify that all tests pass with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n3. **Build Project:** Attempt to build the project using `pnpm build` to confirm that the build process completes successfully.\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Verification:** Run the application locally to ensure it behaves as expected with the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment steps are required. Ensure that the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is included in the deployment to maintain consistency across environments.\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Merge the PR into the main branch.\r\n\r\n2. Pull the latest changes on the deployment environment.\r\n\r\n3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies as per the updated lockfile.\r\n\r\n4. Proceed with the standard deployment process.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nN/A ",

It modifies the tokenizer logic to handle the specific tokenization patterns and configurations required for the `o1` model.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIncluding support for the `o1` model aligns with expanding the capabilities of `js-tiktoken` to handle the latest OpenAI models. This ensures broader usability and aligns with ongoing support for new model releases.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- Updated README to include details on `o1` model support.\r\n- Added an entry to the changelog to document the feature addition.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing changes in the tokenizer logic in `src/tokenizer.js` and the associated test cases in `tests/tokenizer.test.js`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository and check out the branch containing this PR.\r\n2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date.\r\n3. Execute tests with `npm test` and verify that all test cases pass.\r\n4. Manually test by tokenizing examples specific to the `o1` model and comparing output against expected results.\r\n\r\nExample manual test:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { encode } = require('js-tiktoken');\r\nconst model = 'o1';\r\nconst input = 'Hello, this is a test.';\r\nconsole.log(encode(input, model));\r\n",

Minor risks include possible false positives or initial configuration errors, which can be addressed without impact to production workflows.\r\n\r\n# Background  \r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?  \r\nThis PR integrates **CodeQL Analysis** into the GitHub repository to enable automated security scanning of the codebase. CodeQL will analyze code for vulnerabilities, errors, and potential improvements across supported programming languages.  \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?  \r\n**Features** \u2013 Non-breaking change that adds security functionality.  \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?  \r\nTo improve code security and quality by automating the detection of vulnerabilities and providing actionable insights directly within GitHub. This aligns with best practices for secure DevSecOps workflows.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n**My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.**\r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n- Review the **.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml** file to verify the CodeQL setup and configuration.  \r\n- Check the Security tab for CodeQL scan results after testing the workflow.  \r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps  \r\n1. Trigger the CodeQL workflow by pushing new code or opening a pull request.  \r\n2. Verify that the workflow completes successfully.  \r\n3. Confirm that the results are displayed under the Security tab of the repository.  \r\n4. Address any flagged issues and validate that resolved issues no longer appear in subsequent scans.  \r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment instructions are needed. The workflow is self-contained within the repository configuration.\r\n\r\n## Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard GitHub Action setup: merge the PR and ensure the workflow is triggered by future commits or pull requests.  \r\n\r\n---  \r\nThis PR provides the foundation for continuous code security scanning using CodeQL and ensures our repository adheres to security best practices.

There is a risk of potential issues if the frozen lock file is not respected, which could lead to inconsistent dependency versions across environments.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the installation commands across various files to ensure that the `pnpm install` command uses the `--frozen-lockfile` option. This prevents the lock file from being incorrectly updated during installations. Additionally, an explicit update script has been added to allow updates without the frozen lock file option. We updated the .npmrc default to set frozen-lockfile=true and in order to update the lockfile when you add a new dependency in your package.json or bump a version in your package.json you need to explicitly call pnpm i --no-frozen-lockfile \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Improvements**: This change improves the dependency management process by enforcing the use of a consistent lock file during installations.\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

See this branch: [jure/fix-workflows-and-docs](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/tree/jure/fix-workflows-and-docs). I even went so far to try to update Chinese etc. READMEs, which is of course complete nonsense since I don't even understand what is written there. Furthermore, there are scripts that use `pnpm install` that I cannot really test, and since it they are undocumented it's impossible to tell if they should be changed or not.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a thought to update all references to `pnpm install`, but I changed my mind because it's not a black/white decision. People need to understand how lockfiles work, and if they are not using them properly it is not our ability (or responsibility) to educate them. The issues we're seeing today with lockfiles are the result of (1) `npm` / `pnpm`'s design decision (or rather, a change of), and (2) carelesness.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution therefore boils down to PR reviewers. In particular:\r\n- The `main` and `develop` branches should always be \"stable\", i.e. having passing tests\r\n- Whenever a PR introduces a change that causes tests to fail, it should not be merged until the cause of failure is established and corrected.\r\n\r\nThat said, the tests can fail for more than lockfile being out of sync, and we should probably focus on making them work in a reliable way. One of key issues is that our tests depend on external things such as OpenAI and API keys. I would recommend adding a separate smoke test just for OpenAI (a simple `curl` command)."

Any context or related work?  \r\nText-based generation of JSON using LLMs is prone to errors like missing brackets, invalid types, or inconsistent structures. Moving to a typesafe structured output guarantees that JSON complies with predefined schemas, improving both developer experience and system stability.  \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?  \r\n- **My changes require a change to the project documentation.**  \r\n- Updated docs to:  \r\n  - Reflect new structured output implementation.  \r\n  - Mark text-based generation as deprecated.  \r\n\r\n# Testing  \r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps   \r\nN/A just a rename\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\nNo special deployment steps required. \r\n\r\n# Database changes  \r\nNone.  \r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions  \r\nStandard deployment process applies.  \r\n\r\n## Discord username  \r\n0x8664\r\n\r\n---  \r\n",

The solution should:\r\n\r\nFetch chart data, annotations, and other custom elements from TradingView via API.\r\nFormat the content appropriately for Twitter, including text captions for context and hashtags.\r\nProvide options to schedule or instantly post tweets from TradingView without switching between platforms.\r\nInclude settings for customization, such as default hashtags, watermarking charts, or adding predefined text templates.\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nManual Process: Manually screenshotting charts and uploading them to Twitter, but this is inefficient and lacks automation.\r\nThird-party Tools: Using standalone apps like TweetDeck or social media managers, but these don't integrate with TradingView's annotations directly.\r\nCustom Scripts: Writing scripts to automate the TradingView-to-Twitter flow, but this requires significant development time and is not as user-friendly as a plugin-based solution.\r\nAdditional context\r\n\r\nTradingView provides an API that can retrieve chart data and render annotations, which can streamline integration.\r\nThe GOAT plugin already has a Twitter API integration, so extending its capabilities to include TradingView should be feasible.\r\nThis feature could significantly enhance the usability of both tools for traders and content creators.\r\nScreenshot or visual example of an ideal tweet with TradingView integration for reference:\r\n(Include a hypothetical example showing how a TradingView chart and description would appear in a tweet.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, our logging for the Coinbase plugin lacks structured formats and essential context, making it challenging to debug issues effectively and trace requests across services.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a structured logging framework that:\n- Uses JSON format for all logs.\n- Includes standard fields such as timestamp, severity, and correlation ID.\n- Supports context injection for better observability.\n- Has different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).\n- Allows adding custom fields relevant to the Coinbase plugin operations.\n\nFor example, using a logging framework like Winston in Node.js:\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\nlogger.info('User login attempt', { userId: '12345', correlationId: 'abc-123' });\n```\nThis will greatly assist in correlating events and debugging any issues that may arise.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Relying on plain text logs, which can be cumbersome to parse and analyze.\n- Using manual JSON formatting, which is error-prone.\n- Implementing APM tools without a standardized logging approach.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhancing our logging practices will lead to better monitoring, easier log aggregation, and a more consistent logging pattern, ultimately improving our overall observability and debugging capabilities.",

This behavior can cause unexpected issues when deploying or running the application, as the installed packages may not match the versions specified in the lock file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository.\r\n2. Run the command `pnpm install` without the `--frozen-lockfile` option.\r\n3. Observe that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is updated with new versions of dependencies, even if they are not specified in the `package.json`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `pnpm install` command should respect the `--frozen-lockfile` option, preventing any updates to the lock file. This ensures that the installed dependencies match the versions specified in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, maintaining consistency across different environments.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue was addressed in a recent commit that added the `--frozen-lockfile` option to various installation commands in the project, including in the GitHub workflows, Dockerfile, and scripts. The explicit update script was also introduced to allow updates without the frozen lock file option, ensuring that developers can manage dependencies more effectively without risking unintended changes to the lock file.",

New environment variable pattern: `CHARACTER.YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME.SETTING_NAME`\r\n2. Automatic handling of spaces in character names (converted to underscores)\r\n3. Enhanced settings hierarchy:\r\n   - Character-specific namespaced env variables (highest priority)\r\n   - Character settings from JSON\r\n   - Global environment variables\r\n   - Default values\r\n4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing settings system\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Modified settings loader in `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n- Updated character loading in `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n- Added automatic conversion of character name spaces to underscores\r\n\r\n### Documentation Updates\r\nUpdated documentation to reflect the new feature:\r\n1. Added namespaced settings pattern to secrets management guide\r\n2. Updated configuration guide with new examples\r\n3. Updated agent package documentation with hierarchy explanation\r\n4. Added clear examples for both .env and character.json methods\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes - Documentation has been updated to reflect the new feature:\r\n- Added namespaced settings pattern\r\n- Updated configuration examples\r\n- Updated settings hierarchy explanation\r\n- Added character name handling instructions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n### Feature Testing\r\n1. Review code changes:\r\n   - `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n   - `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Test functionality:\r\n   ```env\r\n   # Test with simple name\r\n   CHARACTER.TESTBOT.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test\r\n   \r\n   # Test with spaces in name\r\n   CHARACTER.MY_TEST_BOT.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-other\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Documentation Testing\r\nReview updated docs:\r\n- docs/docs/guides/secrets-management.md\r\n- docs/docs/guides/configuration.md\r\n- docs/docs/packages/agent.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Feature Testing:\r\n   - Create character with spaces in name\r\n   - Add namespaced variables to .env\r\n   - Verify correct loading into character settings\r\n   - Test precedence over character.json settings\r\n   - Verify backward compatibility\r\n   - Test global fallback behavior\r\n\r\n2. Documentation Verification:\r\n   - Verify pattern examples are correct\r\n   - Verify hierarchy explanation is clear\r\n   - Verify character name handling is explained\r\n   - Test example configurations\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nN/A - Feature implementation and documentation changes\r\n",

Any existing direct or telegram conversation is lost. \r\n2) Not a straight-forward mechanism to add new agents - Now with a REST API - load new agents.\r\n\r\nWhy are we doing this?\r\nTo take a step towards multi-character production setup\r\n\r\n### Code Changes made and why?\r\n1. **Created a new table in postgres and sqlite** - Added in the seed file/script of both DBs\r\n`\r\nexport type CharacterTable = {\r\n    id: UUID;                                                // created from stringToUUID - unique and consistent for name\r\n    name: string;\r\n    characterState: Character;                 // A JSONB or TEXT - that maps the character\r\n    secretsIV?: Secrets;                            // Initialisation Vector for each secrets\r\n};\r\n`\r\n**Also added the above in packages/core/src/types.ts**\r\n2. **in SqliteAdapter and PostgresAdapter** - created a new function to load from this characters table\r\n3. **in Agents/src/index.ts** -> \r\n- Assign Directclient to a global variable - along with set and get methods. This is to allow the same direct client be used for character(agent) runtime creation\r\n- A function loadCharactersFromDb loadCharactersFromDb(\r\n                            characterNames?: string\r\n                        ): Promise<Character[]> \r\n    - if any characterNames argument received, it fetches only those characters from db\r\n    - else fetches all characters\r\n    - This handles encryption and decryption of secrets if secrets are present in a character\r\n    - uses env.ENCRYPTION_KEY\r\n- An express server\r\n   - The server starts only when the env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT == true\r\n   - _Why not use the same express server in DirectClient?_ DirectClient does not have access to the DB methods and all the agent-specific handling methods\r\n   - ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - PORT: default. - 3001, overwritten by env AGENT_PORT\r\n4. **in packages/client-direct/src/index.ts**\r\n- Added ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - This endpoint (is a proxy) that routes request to the agent server's route\r\n   -    Before proxying, checks if AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT  ==true and if agents already in runtime\r\n5. created a file **packages/core/src/crypt.ts**\r\n- This handles the encryption and decryption methods\r\n6. created scripts that parses a character json file or all files in a folder and inserts in DB\r\n- Location: scripts/importCharactersInDB/[postgres/sqlite]/insertInDb.js\r\nRequires env variable\r\n`\r\nPOSTGRES_URL= # if postgres\r\nENCRYPTION_KEY=\"\"\r\nINPUT_PATH=characters # the folder path to load the characters from\r\nSQLITE_DB_PATH= #if you want to change db path Default: agent/data/db.sqlite\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Fetching from database during start\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=true\r\n- `pnpm start`\r\n- Will function as usual\r\n- if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n2. Loading an agent during runtime\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=false #if true, we can't test load as all characters in db will be loaded\r\n- set env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT=true\r\n- set env ENCRYPTION_KEY= #use the same encryption key used in insertInDB.js script\r\n- set env AGENT_PORT=4000 #can be empty if we want to pick default port 3001\r\n`pnpm start`\r\n- This will load with the default character Eliza\r\n- `curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/load/trump'` - replace port and character name if using different characters\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 1: agent is loaded and we get success code 200\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 2: agent is already loaded and we get error code 409\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 3: agent does not exist in db and we get error code 404\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 4:  Error during agent load - like incorrect twitter - error code 500\r\n-  if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automtated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

This will also enable autonomous agent to unify all input and outputs into a single stream of thought and action.\r\n\r\n* Unified agent wallet\r\nThe current wallet system reflects the way we use humans use wallets today, but the UX around network switching and wallet management is a pain. Instead, the agent will have a unified wallet, with access to all registered chains at once. No wallet switching, and tokens will all be handled by agents in a unified way.\r\n\r\n* CLI Tool\r\nWe want a create-react-app like experience for creating new projects, and we want CLI handlers for adding and removing plugins, opening chat interface in browser, maybe even deploying like Cloudflare Wrangler to some of our deployment provider friends. Should also handle secrets management and character / agent / conversation management.\r\n\r\n* Model Provider Registry\r\nThe current model provider system requires a pull request to core for every model provider. v2 will have a registry and override pattern so new code doesn't need to be added to core, and any provider can quickly override with a few lines of code to add integration without a pull request.\r\n\r\n* Extensible and generic core framework\r\nThe v1 is very opinionated about prompts, state and some features. v2 will be very extensible so you can create different kinds of agents and override state management and context composition. For advanced developers, this will make the framework far more powerful and flexible for different user cases.\r\n\r\n* Community plugins\r\nWe'll be moving community plugins out of core and adding requirements for plugin inclusion in core around test coverage, documentation and code maintenance and ownership.\r\n\r\n* Better secret management\r\nCurrently, secret management in .env and character files is risky, so considering better and more secure options for this\r\n\r\n* 100% Test Coverage\r\nv2 reflects what we want Eliza to be, and we feel that after these changes we should focus entirely on stability, security and cutting down on issues. We'll be aiming for 100% test coverage of core, adapters and primary components, and end-to-end tests for clients.",

Outdated information can result in inefficiencies, with developers spending unnecessary time answering questions that could otherwise be handled by AI if up-to-date documentation were available\r\n\r\n## **Proposed Solution**\r\n\r\nFirst finish this issue: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1110\r\nNext document plugins so that we have a quality reference: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1200\r\n\r\nThen build a documentation bot that:\r\n1. Tracks and reports TODO comments in code (automate this flow https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1223)\r\n2. Tracks and reports missing plugin docs: (automate this https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1200)\r\n3. Tracks commits / issues / PRs and flags docs pages that might need updating\r\n4. Suggest documentation updates of those pages\r\n\r\n## **Technical Details**\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, maintaining comprehensive JSDoc documentation across our TypeScript codebase is a manual and time-consuming process. This leads to inconsistent documentation coverage and puts an unnecessary burden on developers. We need an automated solution that can help generate and maintain JSDoc comments while ensuring high quality and consistency.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPropose a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\n1. Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4. Configuration:\r\n   - Allows customization of AI prompt templates\r\n   - Provides options to include/exclude specific files or directories\r\n   - Configurable commit message and PR templates\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Manual documentation enforcement through PR checks\r\n2. Using existing JSDoc generation tools like https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc\r\n3. Implementing stricter code review policies for documentation\r\n4. Creating documentation sprints for batch updates\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRequired Permissions and Secrets:\r\n- GitHub token with PR creation permissions\r\n- AI service API key (e.g., OpenAI)\r\n- Repository write access for branch creation\r\n\r\n### Additional Motivation\r\n\r\nThis could be a proof of concept AI junior dev Karpathy talks about\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2c3c68f-d85a-414c-a26f-231bd6ecb831)\r\n\r\n",

After applying this fix, the query execution time dropped to just **0.02 seconds**. This improvement was observed using Supabase analytics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n**Improvements**\r\n- Changes to existing functionality to improve database query performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in `packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts` to understand how sorting and limiting were implemented in the database query.\r\n- Look at the adjusted runtime logic in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` for the integration of the `limit` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3. Monitor query performance with larger datasets to confirm improvements.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Updated query logic to include `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` and optional `LIMIT` in the PostgreSQL adapter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nI will attach screenshots of:\r\n- Successful working run with Postgres and SQLite.\r\n- Successful linting results.\r\n\r\n### Using Postgres adapter\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1054\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 13 52\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3606a21a-6933-402b-ae7d-d24ecb6a1263\" />\r\n<img width=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 15 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b8a289-1cae-4a2f-9493-25cf79dc2d4b\" />\r\n\r\n### Using SQLite adapter\r\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 16 57\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7f49f4-9880-4d4a-9586-d9548fda7dd5\" />\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 18 52\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e04f844-ab14-44e3-a7f4-2601a853af46\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 28 45\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b35cad-c73a-46d0-b52c-5b1e05d87388\" />\r\n<img width=\"777\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 7 29 47\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857b593f-f9e4-4774-a44a-358ea26155d8\" />\r\n",

This PR focuses on enabling multichain support and making the plugin more test-friendly via TDD + a foundation to extend the plugin with more features.\n\nThe GOAT plugin does look interesting, and I\u2019ll take a closer look to see if it aligns with the goals here.\n\nLet me know if you think it\u2019s better to pivot entirely to GOAT, or if continuing with this plugin (and fixing the mentioned issues) is a good path forward!"

The changes add multichain support, refactor the code for better testability, and introduce tests that were previously missing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, my latest commits address Issue #735 and fix the transfer functionality that was mentioned there as seen on the next screenshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"687\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-11 at 3 42 34\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d36a6b-d22f-45f8-86fa-397ab1af7556\">\r\n\r\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything else needed for this PR or if further clarification is required! \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time!"

                "body": "@lessuselesss love this PR, but there are some weird problems that will cause a NixOS user to fail when building the codebase with nix flakes enabled.\r\n\r\nFor example, I built this on my NixOS machine and we see this error:\r\n```\r\nWARN\u2009 Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\ndocs                                     | \u2009WARN\u2009 Unsupported engine: wanted: {\"node\":\"23.3.0\"} (current: {\"node\":\"v20.18.1\",\"pnpm\":\"9.15.0\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may think...what?! No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."

Plugin Tests Status:\r\n- Several plugins executed tests successfully (e.g., solana plugin: 5 tests passed)\r\n- Some failures were observed:\r\n  - plugin-evm: 3 failed tests due to network connectivity issues with IoTeX endpoints\r\n  - plugin-0g: Test process hangs and requires manual interruption\r\n  - Several plugins have no test scripts configured yet\r\n\r\n3.

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a pnpm monorepo using Nix's buildNpmPackage that includes git dependencies (specifically @discordjs/opus), the build fails due to git access restrictions in the Nix build environment. The current workarounds involve either modifying package.json or pre-fetching git dependencies, both of which are not ideal solutions for maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA built-in way to handle git dependencies in buildNpmPackage that:\r\n\r\n 1. Automatically fetches git dependencies using fetchgit during the build process\r\n 2. Maintains compatibility with pnpm workspaces and monorepo structure\r\n 3. Preserves the original package.json without requiring modifications\r\n 4. Works with trusted dependencies in pnpm\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Manually pre-fetching git dependencies and placing them in node_modules\r\n2. Modifying package.json to use published versions instead of git dependencies\r\n3. Using mkDerivation instead of buildNpmPackage to handle the build process manually\r\n4. Creating a custom derivation to handle git dependencies before the main build\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly affects projects using Discord.js and similar packages that rely on git dependencies for native modules. The current workarounds either break the development workflow or require maintaining separate package configurations for Nix builds.\r\nExample of a failing build: \r\n\r\n`ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH Cannot proceed with the frozen installation. The current \"overrides\" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile`\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn the CONTRIBUTING.md file, there's some formatting issues in the branch naming section, :  \r\n\r\nIncorrect nested list numbering (using \"1.\" twice)   \r\nInconsistent formatting for the example (using \"eg.\" instead of \"Example:\")  \r\n\r\nThis inconsistency with our documentation style could lead to confusion and doesn't match the professional tone of the rest of the document.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n1. Use proper sequential numbering (1, 2)\r\n2. Replace \"eg.\" with \"Example:\" to match documentation style\r\n3. Use a more clear example number (9999)\r\n\r\nThe final format should look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\r\n    \r\n    1. The name of the branch should start with the issue number and be descriptive of the changes you are making.  \r\n    2. Example: 9999--add-test-for-bug-123]\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Keeping \"eg.\" but it's less formal than our documentation style\r\n2. Using different formatting like \"For example:\" or \"(example:)\" but \"Example:\" is cleaner\r\n4. Using a bullet point for the example, but numbered lists better show the relationship between the instruction and its example\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis change aligns with our documentation styleguide and makes the contribution guidelines more consistent and professional. It's a small change that improves readability and maintains our documentation standards.\r\n",

While there are translations for several other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc.), Hebrew-speaking users cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important because Hebrew requires special RTL (Right-to-Left) formatting considerations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Hebrew (RTL) translation of the main README.md as README_HE.md, including:  \r\n\r\n - Full translation of all sections including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines  \r\n - Proper RTL formatting using HTML/CSS directives\r\n - Addition of Hebrew (\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\nMaintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) - inadequate because it doesn't handle RTL formatting properly and translations are often inaccurate\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHebrew is spoken by approximately 9 million people globally\r\n\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format)\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to RTL formatting using <div align=\"rtl\"> tags to ensure proper text direction\r\n\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Hebrew-speaking developer community",

Worst case this could break the tests or introduce problems with dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis builds on top of previous changes that introduced the first version of integration tests framework. These changes:\r\n- fix some existing issues with smoke and integration tests failing (esp. giving agent a fixed time to start that was not always sufficient)\r\n- extend integration test library with a full wrapper for setting up / tearing down a test\r\n- refactor existing integration test (\"Hello Trump\") to use new library\r\n- fix a potential issue with possible leak of API keys (not related to integration tests themselves)\r\n- remove a dependency that was previously added but is no longer required\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovement + bug fix + feature\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis is to improve overall project quality via better testing..\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNone\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nTo test the tests, these changes need to be run in CI workflow.\r\nIf either smoke or integration tests fail, the PR should NOT be merged. In that case we will check the logs and update the PR as necessary.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nuser98634",

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/1014\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nWhen the proposed tests are configured to run in CI/CD environment, they need one or more API keys which are considered as secrets. It is necessary to ensure that they are not leaked through workflows being run on behalf of malicious pull requests. In addition to restrictions on running CI/CD workflows we recommend setting up a quota on those keys, and rotating them periodically.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n1. This PR adds two basic tests:\r\n- smoke tests: checks that the project can be built and run\r\n- \"Hello Trump\": checks that the project can use one of the built-in characters (Trump) to successfully query a LLM (OpenAI).\r\n\r\nThe \"Hello Trump\" test requires OpenAI API keys to run. If the API keys are not available, this test will be skipped.\r\n\r\n2. This PR also adds initial (proof of concept) version of integration testing framework. We plan to continue development of this framework in the future as will be adding more integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe goal of these tests is to establish a quality gate that every PR should pass at a minimum. We recommend that the tests are run at least:\r\n- on every PR before merging it\r\n- every time the main/stable branch is updated\r\n\r\nAs a policy, merges to main/stable branch should not be allowed if they would break the tests.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nThe included file `tests/README.md` describes the procedure how to set the tests up in a CI/CD environment. The API keys should be set up the repository settings under \"secrets\". When present, they will automatically be added to the .env file for the duration of the workflow.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThis PR adds a workflow file `integrationTests.yaml` with two jobs. The reviewer should:\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n1. Configure API keys as described in the `tests/README.md`\r\n2. Re-run the workflows and check that both test are passing\r\n3. Check output of jobs for any errors.\r\n4. Adjust workflow rules to trigger workflows as desired (on pull request, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nuser98634\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nCurrently the Solana and EVM Plugin are not aware of the TEE Plugin and a lot of custom code and configuration must be done to add deployment of Eliza agents in a TEE. This PR solves this issue by making the TEE Plugin an opt-in feature that allows developers to build a TEE compatible Eliza Agent to deploy in a Intel TDX Server running the Dstack SDK.\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new env variable called `TEE_MODE` with values of `OFF`, `LOCAL`, `DOCKER`, `PRODUCTION`. When the  `TEE_MODE` is set to an option other than `OFF` or `undefined` then the agent will utilize the TEE Plugin to handle wallet generations for the Solana Plugin.\r\n\r\nEvery time a key is derived to generate a wallet in the Solana Plugin the following happens:\r\n- Derives an ed25519 key based on the value of the `WALLET_SECRET_SALT`\r\n- Generates a Remote Attestation Quote with the `reportdata` that includes a JSON string of `{agentId: ${agentId}, publicKey: ${publicKey}}`\r\n- In the logs, a user can take the RA Quote and the `reportdata` to verify publicly at https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ \r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeature\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. There will be another step in this PR to add documentation within the advanced section to step developers through setting up their Eliza Agent to be TEE compatible. This documentation will take developers through the process of\r\n- Building an Agent locally with TEE_MODE enabled\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a locally deployed Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the TEE Simulator against a docker container of the Eliza Agent\r\n- Run the Eliza Agent within a Real TEE via Phala Network's Dstack Dashboard\r\n- How to verify a Remote Attestation on https://ra-quote-explorer.vercel.app/ and validate the `reportdata` passed into the RA Quote\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nFor our use case at Phala Network, we are building a base template docker image for developers to deploy their agents to our TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Cloud. However, we want to make the loading of the character json file easier to add via a command line argument vs building a new docker image with the new character file. Our main pain point is we want the user journey for technical to non-technical users to be able to publish their character configuration file to a storage protocol like arweave, ipfs, aws, etc. and be able to load those character files in through a command argument. This will make our deploy service easier with a docker compose file that can list the file id location in an argument like `pnpm start --characterUrl=https://characterfile.url`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe developer journey would go as follows:\r\n- Generate a character JSON file through any means (keep this step unopinionated)\r\n- Publish the character file to a storage service. (Ex. Use Thirdweb to post and pin to IPFS https://972b74063c2cd00df1a4cf777bf37d0a.ipfscdn.io/ipfs/bafybeicod5xghpshbxmfb3sh2ccfbb5657dgvxthgwolb42srz4a5iadwm/)\r\n- Create a new CLI argument to the `pnpm start` command named `--characterUrl` that will take in the URL where the character file is hosted\r\n- When the agent is being initialized, `fetch` the character file from the URL and allow for the agent to go through the natural process of starting up the agent\r\n\r\nCode changes should be minimal and would not affect any core functionality so the risk is low.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternatives were building a web app similar to vvaifu, but this would not be a good user experience for cloud deployments or a good strategy to compete with them since we are focused on different problems.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis will help bring more users to Eliza with better security and privacy guarantees by utilizing TEE for safe Eliza agent cloud deployments.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nExample deployment with a mock docker compose file in the TEE Cloud.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0bec2d0-aa0e-418c-bf88-67e37edf1a17)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Client App:\r\n- Added image display support in the chat interface\r\n- Implemented image upload functionality\r\n- Enhanced UI to handle image messages\r\n\r\n2. Client Direct:\r\n- Implemented image attachment handling in the `/:agentId/message` POST endpoint.\r\n- Added static file hosting for the direct client so that generated images and uploaded images can be displayed in the client.\r\n\r\n3. Plugin Node:\r\n- Added a `describeImage` Action in the plugin to take advantage of the `ImageDescriptionService` in the same plugin.\r\n- Modified `recognizeWithOpenAI` and `requestOpenAI` to accept local files, similar to how the first frame of .gif files is converted to a buffer and sent over the API\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `packages/plugin-node/src/services/image.ts` - Core image processing service\r\n2.

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\nfeature: Suppressing initial response messages for specific actions in direct client\r\n\r\nI would like to also extend the twitter client to include this kind of functionality. Right now there is a lot of assumptions about agent behavior such as sending an initial message before an action is processed. Ideally during the upgrade to v2 some of these hard coded behaviors can be addressed. The design should be more conducive to plugin-defined emergent behavior. Maybe there's a discussion to be had at how we can go about this at a lower level rather than going client-by-client to implement this behavior. I'm still relatively new to Eliza community if anyone has groups or public discussions on this.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect the direct client's message handling logic.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds support for suppressing initial response messages in the direct client when actions have `suppressInitialMessage` flag set to true. Some actions might not want to send a message until after the action is completed. Now the action will have to manually send a follow up message with the callback.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (changes to existing message handling features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNew property in the `Action` documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Check the modified message handling logic. I've changed `imageGeneration` action to include `suppressInitialMessage` to true for testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create an action with `suppressInitialMessage: true`\r\n2. Send a message to the direct client that triggers this action\r\n3. Verify only the callback message is sent, not the initial response\r\n\r\nKey test cases:\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: true` should only send callback message\r\n- Action with `suppressInitialMessage: false` or undefined should send both initial and callback messages\r\n- Action callback functionality should work the same regardless of suppression setting\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n```typescript\r\n                // Check if we should suppress the initial message\r\n                const action = runtime.actions.find(\r\n                    (a) => a.name === response.action\r\n                );\r\n                const shouldSuppressInitialMessage =\r\n                    action?.suppressInitialMessage;\r\n\r\n                const _result = await runtime.processActions(\r\n                    memory,\r\n                    [responseMessage],\r\n                    state,\r\n                    async (newMessages) => {\r\n                        message = newMessages;\r\n                        return [memory];\r\n                    }\r\n                );\r\n\r\n                if (!shouldSuppressInitialMessage) {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([response, message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([response]);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    if (message) {\r\n                        res.json([message]);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        res.json([]);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes ensure that when an action has `suppressInitialMessage` set to true:\r\n1. The initial response message is not sent in the API response\r\n2. The action's callback message is still sent if present\r\n3. The response array only includes the callback message",

I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Description: \u201cact\u201d is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n\u2022 How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n\u2022 Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that \u201cact\u201d may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n\u2022 How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

The build process fails when attempting to resolve the image generation plugin import in `defaultCharacter.ts`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- 1. Clone the eliza repository (v0.1.5-alpha.5)\r\n- 2. Import and add the `imageGenerationPlugin` to Eliza in `defaultCharacter.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\nimport { imageGenerationPlugin } from \"@ai16z/plugin-image-generation\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [imageGenerationPlugin],\r\n```\r\n- 3. Run `pnpm build` in the project root\r\n- 4. Build fails with error message indicating it cannot resolve \"@ai16z/plugin-image-generation\" in defaultCharacter.ts\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe build process should successfully compile all packages including @ai16z/eliza. The @ai16z/plugin-image-generation package should be properly resolved as it's listed in the workspace packages.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- Project version: v0.1.5-alpha.\r\n- Build tool: turbo 2.3.3\r\n- Package manager: pnpm\r\n- The package @ai16z/plugin-image-generation is listed in the workspace scope but fails to resolve during build\r\n-

If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nAdd more model providers to provide a more diverse set of model offerings. As another huge plus, hyperbolic is in the web3 space: offering decentralized services for inference and building a verification mechanism for decentralized inference.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nAny documentation necessary for adding Hyperbolic as a model provider.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nI tested locally by running `pnpm dev` with a new character that had `ModelProviderName.HYPERBOLIC` as the modelProvider. Everything seemed to work well.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nRegister at https://app.hyperbolic.xyz.\r\nVisit https://app.hyperbolic.xyz/settings, grab your api key, and add to your `.env` file under `HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

This would allow for direct identification without the need to invoke all providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be using an external mapping or registry system to track and identify providers. However, this approach adds complexity and maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\nAdding an ID to the Provider can streamline operations and improve efficiency when dealing with multiple providers in a system.\r\n\r\n",

If documentation references the Twitter search or model providers, a brief note should be added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review `packages/client-twitter/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-twitter/src/search.ts` to see changes in the Twitter search logic.\r\n- Review `packages/core/src/models.ts` to confirm the addition of the image model for the Galadriel provider.\r\n- Check `docs/docs/guides` and `docs/quickstart.md` for any changes that may need follow-up documentation edits.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Pull down the changes locally.\r\n2. Run the application with the updated code.\r\n3. Verify that the Twitter client no longer starts the search client by default (reducing rate limit concerns).\r\n4. Confirm that the Galadriel image model is listed and accessible as expected.\r\n5. Review logs and behavior to ensure no errors are introduced by the changes.\r\n\r\nNo special UI changes, so no screenshots required.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nDiscord username: `vi0000`\r\n",

            "body": "This is my first attempt to contribute to this project. I have been adding features and additional query capability for the Birdeye API and I think many other could benefit.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\n- plugin ecosystem and capabilities for accessing and querying Birdeye data API\r\n- [Expanding Birdeye thread](https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1318974518680748173)\r\n- possible overlap with: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1366\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- People who already have the BIRDEYE_API_KEY enabled could end up querying the endpoints more\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThis pull request significantly enhances the Birdeye API integration within the AI agent framework by expanding its capabilities beyond basic query functionality. The proposed tools enable more comprehensive and versatile interactions with the Birdeye API, including data clearing and management features. These improvements provide the AI agents with a broader and more efficient toolkit for handling Birdeye API data, enhancing the overall flexibility and utility of the framework for developers and end-users. By extending the scope of the API integration, this contribution supports more robust and scalable solutions within the project.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds providers that represent all the different API endpoints available in the Birdeye API. By doing so, it ensures that when a user requests a specific type of data, the AI agent has a significantly higher likelihood of accessing and utilizing the relevant data in its response. This enhancement maximizes the agent\u2019s ability to provide accurate and contextually rich answers, leveraging the full scope of the Birdeye API.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- net new plugin\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis API connection is critical for enabling the agent to perform research and analyze the dynamics of the ecosystem effectively. By integrating comprehensive access to all Birdeye API endpoints, this PR lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that will further expand the agent's capabilities. This integration not only empowers the agent to deliver more insightful and accurate responses but also positions the framework for scalable growth and the addition of advanced functionalities in the future.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a document change is needed, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Yes, this will require the docs to be updated.

This PR implements a plugin for agents to be able to interact with Cronos ZKEVM.\r\n\r\nIn this first version, only the transfer function is supported. Further work will extend this functionality.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe're seeing a huge proliferation of AI agents being able to manage value on-chain. This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. plugin-solana and others)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the SEND_TOKENS action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in plugin-cronoszkevm\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIn .env you should set the value for CRONOSZKEVM_ADDRESS (this is the public address for the agent account) and CRONOSZKEVM_PRIVATE_KEY (private key for the same account).\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) can be used to send ZKCRO directly to an address on Cronos zkEVM\r\n\r\nRun the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZKCRO to \" - e.g. \"send 1 ZKCRO to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n\r\nAssuming you had 1 ZKCRP to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Cronos zkEVM explorer (https://explorer.zkevm.cronos.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

This was implemented originally by @oberlinstands and probably had a different dev workflow bc the eliza was not built and only the packages were installed. This is why the `/dev/null` may have been required bc the dev needed to build eliza then `pnpm start` inside the container.\r\n\r\nIn the package.json file we can see `pnpm docker` will execute this script for all 3 docker commands `build`, `run` and `bash`.  \r\n```\r\n\"docker:build\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh build\",\r\n\"docker:run\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh run\",\r\n\"docker:bash\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh bash\",\r\n\"docker:start\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh start\",\r\n\"docker\": \"pnpm docker:build && pnpm docker:run && pnpm docker:bash\",\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/438c1f1400e365510cae9c19dfc35ca4f663512d/package.json#L20C10-L20C78\r\n\r\nIf checking the `docker run` script, we can see that the command is executed based on this logic\r\n```\r\n # Start building the docker run command\r\nCMD=\"docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 3000:3000 -d\"\r\n\r\n# Add base mounts\r\nfor mount in \"${BASE_MOUNTS[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/$mount\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add package mounts\r\nfor package in \"${PACKAGES[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/$package/src:/app/packages/$package/src\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add core types mount separately (special case)\r\nCMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/core/types:/app/packages/core/types\\\"\"\r\n\r\n# Add container name and image\r\nCMD=\"$CMD --name eliza eliza\"\r\n\r\n# Execute the command\r\neval $CMD\r\n;;\r\n ```\r\n \r\nFor the last command `docker bash`, then we see that this. may be the culprit since it will try run \r\n```\r\n# Check if the container is running before executing bash\r\nif [ \"$(docker ps -q -f name=eliza)\" ]; then\r\n   docker exec -it eliza bash\r\nelse\r\n   echo \"Container 'eliza' is not running. Please start it first.\"\r\n   exit 1\r\nfi\r\n;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run a test on `pnpm docker`, I will see this result:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3596cc8b-12ae-452c-bb7c-1fdf648c8ccc)\r\n\r\nI think the change we are looking for is to remove bash command from the `pnpm docker` package script & let the docker image be built and run. If there are errors whenever this happens, then execute pnpm docker:bash to debug the docker image & find out what the problems are."

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt [`Yotta Labs`](https://www.yottalabs.ai/), we are transforming global computing into a high-performance, decentralized AI platform. As part of this mission, I integrated the AI Agent functionality and selected the Eliza framework for managing agent-related tasks. \r\n\r\nWhile configuring the Twitter client and successfully logging into my account, I noticed an issue in the runtime logs: the message `[\"\u25ce Next tweet scheduled in 128 minutes\"]` appeared twice. This indicates that `generateNewTweetLoop` was called twice, resulting in two independent tweet scheduling loops being initialized.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs because the `start` method in `/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts` calls `generateNewTweetLoop` twice\u2014once at line 174 and again at line 190\u2014without any conditional checks to prevent multiple timers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add the following code to the relevant `character.json` file:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   \"clients\": [\"twitter\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the Twitter-related parameters in the `.env` file, and set `POST_IMMEDIATELY=true` to enable immediate tweet posting.\r\n\r\n3. Start the model service.\r\n\r\n4. Check Twitter, and you will find that two tweets are posted simultaneously. Additionally, the logs show the message `Next tweet scheduled in xxx minutes` printed twice.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe generateNewTweetLoop method should only be invoked once during the start method, ensuring that only a single tweet scheduling loop is active. This would prevent duplicate logs and redundant scheduling timers.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebe87aa-ff46-488d-9961-90daf43b5aab\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- File: /packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\n- Method: start\r\n- Lines: 174 and 190\r\n- Observed Behavior: generateNewTweetLoop is called twice without a conditional check, causing two scheduling loops to be initialized.\r\n- Move second generateNewTweetLoop() inside the if (enableActionProcessing)",

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when the Farcaster client generates responses that should trigger actions (like following a user or reacting to a cast), these actions are not being executed. This happens because:\r\n\r\n1. The action information is being lost during the response chain\r\n2. The cast hash, which is necessary for some actions, is not properly stored in the message memory\r\n3. The action handlers don't receive the complete context they need\r\n\r\nThis bug prevents important bot functionalities from working, such as:\r\n\r\n- Automatic following of users who interact with the bot\r\n- Reacting to casts when appropriate\r\n- Any custom actions defined in the bot's behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1.

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Shaiw Talks like Shaw\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241b9420-8a6c-4115-ba73-7438bba91156)\r\n\r\n### Casual Conversation\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d2b4a44-da93-4c80-902d-284222855811)\r\n\r\n### More\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf96ba-6f0b-4f58-8714-2fbc048b962e)\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nCaution: the docs site is crawled and inserted into vectordb on launch, each time you load the agent, this will happen. During testing, I suggest using cleanstart startup script, to wipe the database.  In production, this will need to be managed through db, if new pages are loaded.  This may need fixed in future to make this easier to manage.\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n## Database changes\r\nNeed to change from sqlite, to the database you use in test/production.\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n## Discord username\r\naah8098 (Allen)\r\n",

This has slowed down the development/debugging process considerably. \r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex.

Update `generateText` API to be able to pass through tool options to leverage the model's tool calling capabilities\r\n2. Update the GOAT plugin to use tool calling allowing it to perform complex onchain actions that require multiple steps. Now developers can define high level actions (swap, bet on Polymarket, stake, etc.) and GOAT will take care of handling each action (see the screenshots below)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and build it\r\n2. Set up the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` env variables\r\n3. Uncomment lines 70-72 in the `actions.ts` file in the GOAT plugin\r\n4. Prompt the agent with \"Swap 0.1 USDC for MODE using KIM in a single hop\"\r\n5. In the agent logs you should see all the different steps that the agent is making\r\n6. The tx should fail unless you have ETH and USDC in MODE :)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\nAgent can just do one function call so you need to specify the inputs like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cec757-fdb1-43b8-affc-562380a38184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After\r\nAgent can do multiple function calls in an action so inputs are more human friendly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f80382c-f48f-4096-a2ab-a2cafa72477d)\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also log all the different tool interactions:\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 16 24 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627792d8-eeb7-4110-b2ef-33dd8c83f3da\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\naguspunk\r\n",

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to easily pass secrets to the GOAT plugin as well as improve its readme.\r\n\r\nProblem: \r\nCurrenlty secrets can only be used by plugins when calling an action or a provider. If a plugin requires an initial setup such as setting up a wallet or a GOAT plugin (e.g adding Polymarket or Uniswap plugins) there is no way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nUpdate the GOAT plugin to get passed a `getSecrets` function for the specific character it is adding actions to. This allows GOAT to check the secrets/env variables and configure its plugins accordingly when being initialized.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements: This change allows developers to install GOAT plugins easily such as Polymarket, Uniswap and Coingecko. It also makes it easier to update the plugin to support multi-chain.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Make sure you have an `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` for Base set\r\n2. Comment out `evmPlugin` in `src/agent.ts`\r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: What's the USDC balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n4. Should give you the balance of `0x18Bead774f927Af586F86F6d054C269416E163DD`\r\n\r\nTo test actions on Base Sepolia simply:\r\n1. Go to `plugin-goat/src/wallet.ts` and change\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = base \r\n```\r\nto\r\n```typescript\r\nconst chain = sepolia\r\n```\r\n2. Make sure `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` works for Sepolia\r\n3. Run the agent!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\naguspunk\r\n",

This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. \n\n### Details\nI have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so). However, as far as I can see from the code, it is still present in master branch at time of writing, on line [403/404 of network.js](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/blob/3a92931c7d46605ffddc1aacb97a9727273b2888/lib/network.js#L403).\n\nThe SSID is obtained from `netsh wlan show interface ...` in `getWindowsWirelessIfaceSSID`, and then passed to `cmd.exe /d /s /c \"netsh wlan show profiles ...` in `getWindowsIEEE8021x`, without sanitization.\n\n### PoC\nFirst, the command injection payload should be included in the connected Wi-Fi SSID. For example create hotspot on mobile phone or other laptop, set SSID to payload, connect to it with victim Windows system. Two example SSID's to demonstrate exploitation are below.\n\nDemonstration to run ping command indefinitely:\n```\na\" | ping /t 127.0.0.1 &\n```\n\nRun executable with privileges of the user in which vulnerable function is executed. Chosen executable should should be placed in (assuming system drive is C): `C:\\a\\a.exe`.\n```\na\" | %SystemDrive%\\a\\a.exe &\n```\n\nThen, the vulnerable function can be executed on the victim system, for example, using:\n```\nconst si = require('systeminformation');\nsi.networkInterfaces((net) => { console.log(net) });\n```\n\nNow the chosen command, `PING.exe` or `a.exe` will be run through the cmd.exe command line.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation.\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>sebhildebrandt/systeminformation (systeminformation)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.23.8`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.6...v5.23.8)\n\n### [`v5.23.6`](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/compare/v5.23.5...v5.23.6)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n\ud83d\udea6 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache\n2. npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces\n3. installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation)\n\nThis can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B\n\nUsers generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it).\n\nHere, that expectation is broken\n\n### Details\n\nSee PoC.\n\nIn it, overrides from a single run of A get leaked into e.g. `~/Library/Caches/pnpm/metadata/registry.npmjs.org/rimraf.json` and persistently affect all other projects using the cache\n\n### PoC\n\nPostinstall code used in PoC is benign and can be inspected in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ponyhooves?activeTab=code>, it's just a `console.log`\n\n1. Remove store and cache\n   On mac: `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/pnpm ~/Library/pnpm/store`\n   This step is not required in general, but we'll be using a popular package for PoC that's likely cached\n2. Create `A/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"A\",\n     \"pnpm\": { \"overrides\": { \"rimraf>glob\": \"npm:ponyhooves@1\" } },\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i --ignore-scripts` (the flag is not required, but the point of the demo is to show that it doesn't help)\n4. Create `B/package.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"B\",\n     \"dependencies\": { \"rimraf\": \"6.0.1\" }\n   }\n   ```\n   Install it with `pnpm i`\n\nResult:\n```console\nPackages: +3\n+++\nProgress: resolved 3, reused 3, downloaded 0, added 3, done\nnode_modules/.pnpm/ponyhooves@1.0.1/node_modules/ponyhooves: Running postinstall script, done in 51ms\n\ndependencies:\n+ rimraf 6.0.1\n\nDone in 1.4s\n```\n\nAlso, that code got leaked into another project and it's lockfile now! \n\n### Impact\n\nGlobal state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs\n\nAs a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pnpm/pnpm

The woman is sitting on the sand, wearing a plaid shirt, and appears to be engaged in a playful interaction with the dog. The dog, which is a large breed, is sitting on its hind legs and appears to be reaching out to the woman, possibly to give her a high-five or a paw. The background shows the ocean with gentle waves, and the sky is clear, suggesting it might be either sunrise or sunset. The overall atmosphere is calm and relaxed, capturing a moment of connection between the woman and the dog.\n```\n\n<h3 id=\"jina_clip\">JinaCLIP for multimodal embeddings</h3>\n\nJinaCLIP is a series of general-purpose multilingual multimodal embedding models for text & images, created by Jina AI.\n\n**Example:** Compute text and/or image embeddings with `jinaai/jina-clip-v2`:\n\n```js\nimport { AutoModel, AutoProcessor, RawImage, matmul } from \"@&#8203;huggingface/transformers\";\n\n// Load processor and model\nconst model_id = \"jinaai/jina-clip-v2\";\nconst processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id);\nconst model = await AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_id, { dtype: \"q4\" /* e.g., \"fp16\", \"q8\", or \"q4\" */ });\n\n// Prepare inputs\nconst urls = [\"https://i.ibb.co/nQNGqL0/beach1.jpg\", \"https://i.ibb.co/r5w8hG8/beach2.jpg\"];\nconst images = await Promise.all(urls.map(url => RawImage.read(url)));\nconst sentences = [\n    \"\u063a\u0631\u0648\u0628 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0637\u0626\", // Arabic\n    \"\u6d77\u6ee9\u4e0a\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u65e5\u843d\", // Chinese\n    \"Un beau coucher de soleil sur la plage\", // French\n    \"Ein wundersch\u00f6ner Sonnenuntergang am Strand\", // German\n    \"\u0388\u03bd\u03b1 \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf \u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\", // Greek\n    \"\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0924\u091f \u092a\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u0916\u0942\u092c\u0938\u0942\u0930\u0924 \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\", // Hindi\n    \"Un bellissimo tramonto sulla spiaggia\", // Italian\n    \"\u6d5c\u8fba\u306b\u6c88\u3080\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u5915\u65e5\", // Japanese\n    \"\ud574\ubcc0 \uc704\ub85c \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubab0\", // Korean\n];\n\n// Encode text and images\nconst inputs = await processor(sentences, images, { padding: true, truncation: true });\nconst { l2norm_text_embeddings, l2norm_image_embeddings } = await model(inputs);\n\n// Encode query (text-only)\nconst query_prefix = \"Represent the query for retrieving evidence documents: \";\nconst query_inputs = await processor(query_prefix + \"beautiful sunset over the beach\");\nconst { l2norm_text_embeddings: query_embeddings } = await model(query_inputs);\n\n// Compute text-image similarity scores\nconst text_to_image_scores = await matmul(query_embeddings, l2norm_image_embeddings.transpose(1, 0));\nconsole.log(\"text-image similarity scores\", text_to_image_scores.tolist()[0]); // [0.29530206322669983, 0.3183615803718567]\n\n// Compute image-image similarity scores\nconst image_to_image_score = await matmul(l2norm_image_embeddings[0], l2norm_image_embeddings[1]);\nconsole.log(\"image-image similarity score\", image_to_image_score.item()); // 0.9344457387924194\n\n// Compute text-text similarity scores\nconst text_to_text_scores = await matmul(query_embeddings, l2norm_text_embeddings.transpose(1, 0));\nconsole.log(\"text-text similarity scores\", text_to_text_scores.tolist()[0]); // [0.5566609501838684, 0.7028406858444214, 0.582255482673645, 0.6648036241531372, 0.5462006330490112, 0.6791588068008423, 0.6192430257797241, 0.6258729100227356, 0.6453716158866882]\n```\n\n<h3 id=\"llava_onevision\">LLaVA-OneVision for Image-Text-to-Text</h3>\n\nLLaVA-OneVision is a Vision-Language Model that can generate text conditioned on one or several images/videos.

The most popular model, [deepseek-ai/Janus-1.3B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/Janus-1.3B), is tagged as an \"any-to-any\" model, and has specifically been trained for the following tasks:\n\n**Example:** Image-Text-to-Text\n\n```js\nimport { AutoProcessor, MultiModalityCausalLM } from \"@&#8203;huggingface/transformers\";\n\n// Load processor and model\nconst model_id = \"onnx-community/Janus-1.3B-ONNX\";\nconst processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id);\nconst model = await MultiModalityCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id);\n\n// Prepare inputs\nconst conversation = [\n  {\n    role: \"User\",\n    content: \"<image_placeholder>\\nConvert the formula into latex code.\",\n    images: [\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xenova/transformers.js-docs/resolve/main/quadratic_formula.png\"],\n  },\n];\nconst inputs = await processor(conversation);\n\n// Generate response\nconst outputs = await model.generate({\n  ...inputs,\n  max_new_tokens: 150,\n  do_sample: false,\n});\n\n// Decode output\nconst new_tokens = outputs.slice(null, [inputs.input_ids.dims.at(-1), null]);\nconst decoded = processor.batch_decode(new_tokens, { skip_special_tokens: true });\nconsole.log(decoded[0]);\n```\n\nSample output:\n\n    Sure, here is the LaTeX code for the given formula:\n\n    ```\n    x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4a c}}{2a}\n    ```\n\n    This code represents the mathematical expression for the variable \\( x \\).\n\n**Example:** Text-to-Image\n\n```js\nimport { AutoProcessor, MultiModalityCausalLM } from \"@&#8203;huggingface/transformers\";\n\n// Load processor and model\nconst model_id = \"onnx-community/Janus-1.3B-ONNX\";\nconst processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id);\nconst model = await MultiModalityCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id);\n\n// Prepare inputs\nconst conversation = [\n  {\n    role: \"User\",\n    content: \"A cute and adorable baby fox with big brown eyes, autumn leaves in the background enchanting,immortal,fluffy, shiny mane,Petals,fairyism,unreal engine 5 and Octane Render,highly detailed, photorealistic, cinematic, natural colors.\",\n  },\n];\nconst inputs = await processor(conversation, { chat_template: \"text_to_image\" });\n\n// Generate response\nconst num_image_tokens = processor.num_image_tokens;\nconst outputs = await model.generate_images({\n  ...inputs,\n  min_new_tokens: num_image_tokens,\n  max_new_tokens: num_image_tokens,\n  do_sample: true,\n});\n\n// Save the generated image\nawait outputs[0].save(\"test.png\");\n```\n\nSample outputs:\n\n|  ![fox\\_1](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a4f588-655f-440e-bd55-79d19505edae)  | ![fox\\_2](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b5003a-82de-4ef9-8315-6cb59aee607d) | ![fox\\_3](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/f92ed498-4a32-4757-86de-cac37bc8fbf6) | ![fox\\_4](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/51b9d0a6-c737-499d-983e-d89ff023282d) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| ![fox\\_5](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/8876ebb0-fea2-4443-b458-fdd6c035a69f) | ![fox\\_6](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/1989f128-5fd4-4b0c-83b4-dc5f33b388c2) | ![fox\\_7](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa9ac58-ca14-4ee3-84ca-47e69de2589c) | ![fox\\_8](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a20642-a336-4277-9056-f45d7ddb3bbe) |\n\nWhat to play around with the model?

It introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, allowing the model to process images of varying resolutions and leading to more efficient and accurate visual representations.\n\n```js\nimport { AutoProcessor, Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, RawImage } from \"@&#8203;huggingface/transformers\";\n\n// Load processor and model\nconst model_id = \"onnx-community/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct\";\nconst processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id);\nconst model = await Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id);\n\n// Prepare inputs\nconst url = \"https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg\";\nconst image = await (await RawImage.read(url)).resize(448, 448);\nconst conversation = [\n  {\n    role: \"user\",\n    content: [\n      { type: \"image\" },\n      { type: \"text\", text: \"Describe this image.\" },\n    ],\n  },\n];\nconst text = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, { add_generation_prompt: true });\nconst inputs = await processor(text, image);\n\n// Perform inference\nconst outputs = await model.generate({\n  ...inputs,\n  max_new_tokens: 128,\n});\n\n// Decode output\nconst decoded = processor.batch_decode(\n  outputs.slice(null, [inputs.input_ids.dims.at(-1), null]),\n  { skip_special_tokens: true },\n);\nconsole.log(decoded[0]);\n// The image depicts a serene beach scene with a woman and a dog. The woman is sitting on the sand, wearing a plaid shirt, and appears to be engaged in a playful interaction with the dog. The dog, which is a large breed, is sitting on its hind legs and appears to be reaching out to the woman, possibly to give her a high-five or a paw. The background shows the ocean with gentle waves, and the sky is clear, suggesting it might be either sunrise or sunset. The overall atmosphere is calm and relaxed, capturing a moment of connection between the woman and the dog.\n```\n\n<h3 id=\"jina_clip\">JinaCLIP for multimodal embeddings</h3>\n\nJinaCLIP is a series of general-purpose multilingual multimodal embedding models for text & images, created by Jina AI.\n\n**Example:** Compute text and/or image embeddings with `jinaai/jina-clip-v2`:\n\n```js\nimport { AutoModel, AutoProcessor, RawImage, matmul } from \"@&#8203;huggingface/transformers\";\n\n// Load processor and model\nconst model_id = \"jinaai/jina-clip-v2\";\nconst processor = await AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id);\nconst model = await AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_id, { dtype: \"q4\" /* e.g., \"fp16\", \"q8\", or \"q4\" */ });\n\n// Prepare inputs\nconst urls = [\"https://i.ibb.co/nQNGqL0/beach1.jpg\", \"https://i.ibb.co/r5w8hG8/beach2.jpg\"];\nconst images = await Promise.all(urls.map(url => RawImage.read(url)));\nconst sentences = [\n    \"\u063a\u0631\u0648\u0628 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0637\u0626\", // Arabic\n    \"\u6d77\u6ee9\u4e0a\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u65e5\u843d\", // Chinese\n    \"Un beau coucher de soleil sur la plage\", // French\n    \"Ein wundersch\u00f6ner Sonnenuntergang am Strand\", // German\n    \"\u0388\u03bd\u03b1 \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf \u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\", // Greek\n    \"\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0924\u091f \u092a\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u0916\u0942\u092c\u0938\u0942\u0930\u0924 \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\", // Hindi\n    \"Un bellissimo tramonto sulla spiaggia\", // Italian\n    \"\u6d5c\u8fba\u306b\u6c88\u3080\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u5915\u65e5\", // Japanese\n    \"\ud574\ubcc0 \uc704\ub85c \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubab0\", // Korean\n];\n\n// Encode text and images\nconst inputs = await processor(sentences, images, { padding: true, truncation: true });\nconst { l2norm_text_embeddings, l2norm_image_embeddings } = await model(inputs);\n\n// Encode query (text-only)\nconst query_prefix = \"Represent the query for retrieving evidence documents: \";\nconst query_inputs = await processor(query_prefix + \"beautiful sunset over the beach\");\nconst { l2norm_text_embeddings: query_embeddings } = await model(query_inputs);\n\n// Compute text-image similarity scores\nconst text_to_image_scores = await matmul(query_embeddings, l2norm_image_embeddings.transpose(1, 0));\nconsole.log(\"text-image similarity scores\", text_to_image_scores.tolist()[0]); // [0.29530206322669983, 0.3183615803718567]\n\n// Compute image-image similarity scores\nconst image_to_image_score = await matmul(l2norm_image_embeddings[0], l2norm_image_embeddings[1]);\nconsole.log(\"image-image similarity score\", image_to_image_score.item()); // 0.9344457387924194\n\n// Compute text-text similarity scores\nconst text_to_text_scores = await matmul(query_embeddings, l2norm_text_embeddings.transpose(1, 0));\nconsole.log(\"text-text similarity scores\", text_to_text_scores.tolist()[0]); // [0.5566609501838684, 0.7028406858444214, 0.582255482673645, 0.6648036241531372, 0.5462006330490112, 0.6791588068008423, 0.6192430257797241, 0.6258729100227356, 0.6453716158866882]\n```\n\n<h3 id=\"llava_onevision\">LLaVA-OneVision for Image-Text-to-Text</h3>\n\nLLaVA-OneVision is a Vision-Language Model that can generate text conditioned on one or several images/videos.

Lastly, don\u2019t forget to include your .env configurations in the .env.example file for consistency."

            "body": "\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nTypeScript type error in Slack client when handling message attachments. The error occurs because the `attachments` property in the `Content` interface expects an array of `Media` type objects, but the code was only providing a subset of the required properties.\r\n\r\n**Error message:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ text: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Media[]'.\r\nType '{ text: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Media': id, url, title, source, description\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the Slack client implementation.\r\n2. Try to create a message content with attachments.\r\n3. The code attempts to create an attachment with only the `text` property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent ? [{ text: attachmentContent }] : undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code should properly implement the `Media` type interface by providing all required properties:\r\n\r\n- `id` (string)\r\n- `url` (string)\r\n- `title` (string)\r\n- `source` (string)\r\n- `description` (string)\r\n- `text` (string)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the attachment creation to include all required `Media` type properties:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent\r\n    ? [{\r\n        id: stringToUuid(`${event.ts}-attachment`),\r\n        url: '',  // Since this is text content, no URL is needed\r\n        title: 'Text Attachment',\r\n        source: 'slack',\r\n        description: 'Text content from Slack message',\r\n        text: attachmentContent\r\n    }]\r\n    : undefined,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue affects the Slack client's message handling functionality in the `packages/client-slack/src/messages.ts` file. The fix ensures type safety while maintaining the intended functionality of handling text attachments from Slack messages.",

This is particularly important as it will improve accessibility and inclusivity for the growing tech community in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Tagalog translation of the main README.md as README_TG.md, including:\r\n- Full translation of all sections, including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines\r\n- Proper formatting to ensure readability\r\n- Addition of Tagalog (Tagalog) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\n- Maintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) \u2013 inadequate because automated translations may not accurately capture technical terms and nuances in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTagalog is spoken by millions of Filipinos and is one of the primary languages in the Philippines.\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format).\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Filipino developer community.\r\n",

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\n\r\n1. Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241222%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241222T094432Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=1a5dd5544d9787bd4b80ce1fa9db82a9647389b7df93cfd2c0c41a3d7400e4b9)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![img](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n \r\n# Detailed testing steps\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Run verifiable Eliza in the TEE.\r\n2. Verifiable log for Eliza in the TEE.\r\n\r\nAdd a verifiable log plugin to enable Eliza to sign verifiable logs and provide an interactive query interface. So external parties can query the verifiable logs and verify Eliza's execution process through signature validation.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEliza running in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is verifiable, ensuring that the AI agent operates strictly according to the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, further development is needed for external parties to verify what Eliza specifically did: external parties should be able to access Eliza's operation logs, and Eliza must use a key pair derived from the TEE to sign these logs. This enables the logs to be verified as authentically originating from Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\n![https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70](https://artela-oss.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/eliza/teeplugin.png?x-oss-credential=LTAI5tAZoW7ZWzrSERMJYgbR%2F20241220%2Fus-west-1%2Foss%2Faliyun_v4_request&x-oss-date=20241220T021204Z&x-oss-expires=32400&x-oss-signature-version=OSS4-HMAC-SHA256&x-oss-signature=69754a19022582bbc15b8896f4c8cb195d6bfd90a62d3393d09d29ff37f22c70)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of an Eliza AI agent running a Twitter client, it could be verified which tweets were posted by Eliza and which were directly posted by a human manually operating the Twitter account.\r\n\r\nFuture: Based on this plugin, other clients and plugins can generate verifiable logs that need to be authenticated externally. We can further develop a verifiable terminal for TEE Eliza to display signed, verifiable logs in real-time.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature\r\n- TEE plugin\r\n- Verifiable feature\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, we will add documentation for using this plugin, including the guide on how other plugins can import it and generate verifiable logs.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **Understand the existing `plugin-tee`**\r\n    1. We rely on Eliza's existing `plugin-tee` and use its key derivation interface.\r\n    \r\n2. **Understand what `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` does**\r\n    1. **Derive a key pair for verifiable logs**: It uses the TEE to derive a key pair specifically for signing verifiable logs.\r\n    2. **Remote attestation**: The public key of verifiable logs is embedded in the remote attestation report, making it accessible for external verification.\r\n    3. **Sign logs**: This plugin accepts logs passed in from external modules (e.g., tweets sent and received by a Twitter client, or executed actions), signs them with the TEE-derived key pair, and stores them in the database.\r\n    4. **Verification**: External entities can use the remotely attested public key to verify these logs, ensuring that certain actions were indeed performed by TEE Eliza.\r\n    \r\n3. **What is not included in this PR**\r\n    1. **Adding RPC interfaces for the direct client**: For example, support for remote attestation and querying the public key for verifiable logs. This feature will be submitted in a separate PR that depends on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and modifies the direct client.\r\n    2. **Support for `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` in existing clients**: Enhancements for existing clients to generate verifiable logs that need external validation. For instance, modifying the Twitter client to depend on `plugin-tee-verifiable-log` and produce logs that are worthy of external verification.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nIt have completed the integration tests and can run the `pnpm test` file in the test directory.\r\n",

Any context or related work?\r\nThis client allows agents to post to Lens, a social graph that is permissionless and provides a more onchain environment for agents, with a variety of monetization options including collectable posts and open actions.\r\n\r\nThis client is similar to the latest Farcaster client and serves as a base for other devs to include more Lens functionality.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nA few `.env` variables are needed \r\n- get an evm wallet private key\r\n- get a lens profile owned by the same wallet: https://onboarding.lens.xyz/mint\r\n- get ipfs api credentials: https://storj.dev/dcs/api/storj-ipfs-pinning\r\n\r\n```\r\n# client-lens\r\nEVM_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\nLENS_PROFILE_ID=\r\nSTORJ_API_USERNAME=\r\nSTORJ_API_PASSWORD=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `defaultCharacter.ts` - add the new client to the `clients` array\r\n```\r\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"./types.ts\";\r\n\r\nexport const defaultCharacter: Character = {\r\n    name: \"Eliza\",\r\n    username: \"eliza\",\r\n    plugins: [],\r\n    clients: [Clients.LENS],\r\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.GROK,\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. set new `.env` variables\r\n2. add client to character file\r\n3. start the server\r\n4. agent fetches timeline to generate a new post, and fetches mentions to generate comments\r\n5. if agent creates a post, check it at `https://hey.xyz/u/{agentHandle}`\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n`imthatcarlos`\r\n",

This is how choosing the action replies on Twitter works when the agent would like, re-tweet, Quote, or reply. \n\nIf I want a template to do conditional logic that executes 100% correctly, like a calculation, it would be beneficial, but maybe it's better to add tools for that case.\n\nFrom my point of view, this starts to approach a customized agent direction that requires new builds every time you add new logic. But if it doesn't break all templates w/ the new type accepting strings, then this can be useful.\n\nSome questions:\n- Does this require also editing all the other templates among the different clients as well?\n- Can we expand on the doc to make sure devs understand how to implement this?"

It simply introduces the possibility to pass a function that will resolve the template string. For me, this improves the developer experience by allowing developers to more easily customize their agents, and I\u2019m personally a fan of using function resolvers when building SDKs.\n\nI updated the related documentation I could find, but I may have missed something."

The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single \u201ccharacter\u201d agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAt _packages/core/src/generate.ts_ When the `imageModelProvider` did not match `modelProvider`, the code iteratively checked for API keys in a fallback chain. It stopped at the first available key (e.g., FAL_API_KEY), even if it belonged to the wrong provider. As a result, the selected API key could be incorrect (e.g., returning and using a key from FAL instead key from Venice).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set imageModelProvider to VENICE in the character configuration.\r\n2. Provide both FAL_API_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in .env(or any other relevant key combination).\r\n3. When requesting an image generation observe that the code selects FAL_API_KEY instead of VENICE_API_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf a specific imageModelProvider is set, the code should return the matching API key for that provider if it exists. If no specific provider key is found, the code should then try the fallback chain in sequence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c086855-48b3-42ba-b410-6f87c2513711)\r\n\r\n**Fix** \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59fae1b-652c-41e1-9540-fa2c2a85cba7)\r\n\r\n`const apiKey =\r\n    runtime.imageModelProvider === runtime.modelProvider\r\n        ? runtime.token\r\n        : (() => {\r\n            // First try to match the specific provider\r\n            switch (runtime.imageModelProvider) {\r\n                case ModelProviderName.HEURIST:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.TOGETHER:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.FAL:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.OPENAI:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\");\r\n                case ModelProviderName.VENICE:\r\n                    return runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n                default:\r\n                    // If no specific match, try the fallback chain\r\n                    return (runtime.getSetting(\"HEURIST_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"FAL_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ??\r\n                           runtime.getSetting(\"VENICE_API_KEY\");\r\n            }\r\n        })();`\r\n\r\nThis fix updates the logic to first attempt to retrieve the API key from the specifically selected imageModelProvider. If that is not present, it will proceed down the fallback chain. This ensures that if an an image model api key is set, it is correctly chosen over other existing keys which are higher in the selection list, like FAL_API_KEY.\r\n\r\nPS: Solution is implemented and tested, creating bug report for tracked pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This should be removed so that character card bios can be updated upon restart.  There's not much of a performance gain from caching anyway, as the bio is only loaded once on startup.\r\n\r\ntwitter login Cookies are also cached indefinitely, not sure if that's good or bad, but it doesn't seem right to me as twitter login cookies should eventually expire.",

A\r\nmain .gitignore file has already been created at the root level, which\r\ncontains all the necessary exclusions, including those for .ts files. This\r\neliminates the need for a separate .gitignore file in the agent/ folder.\r\n\r\n2- I have corrected the hardcoded path issue by replacing it with a\r\nrelative path using __dirname for better portability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n3-I understand the concern about deleting sample characters. To test our\r\nsports analysis functionality, I temporarily replaced the sample character\r\nfile but have since reverted it back. Rest assured, I have all the original\r\nsample files, including the personality you provided and the ones we tested.\r\n\r\nOn Tue, 10 Dec 2024 at 12:00, Odilitime ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n\r\n> ***@***.**** requested changes on this pull request.\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> On agent/.gitignore\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878363005>:\r\n>\r\n> Revert or explain why this is necessary\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> In agent/src/services/twitter/services.ts\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878369796>:\r\n>\r\n> > +// Load environment variables from .env file\r\n> +dotenv.config();\r\n> +\r\n> +// Define constants\r\n> +const BEARER_TOKEN = process.env.BEARER_TOKEN;\r\n> +const BASE_URL = \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent\";\r\n> +\r\n> +/**\r\n> + * Fetch recent tweets related to sports.\r\n> + * @param maxResults Number of tweets to fetch (default: 10)\r\n> + */\r\n> +\r\n> +// this function will get data from documnets for buliding custom knowledge base\r\n> +export const fetchDocuments = async (): Promise<string[]> => {\r\n> +    const pdfService = new PdfService();\r\n> +    const pdfFilePath = \"C:/Users/Dell/eliza-1/agent/src/services/twitter/game.pdf\";  //a dummy pdf\r\n>\r\n> no hard coded paths, node has __dirname if you want to give a relative\r\n> path to this file\r\n> https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#__dirname\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n>\r\n> On characters/trump.character.json\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#discussion_r1878371462>:\r\n>\r\n> I'm not sure we should be deleting our sample characters without replacing\r\n> them\r\n>\r\n> \u2014\r\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/pull/971#pullrequestreview-2492783366>,\r\n> or unsubscribe\r\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/A25IBTDKIAJAXDO3DUXL2E32E4FYHAVCNFSM6AAAAABTLDQIYOVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43YUDVNRWFEZLROVSXG5CSMV3GSZLXHMZDIOJSG44DGMZWGY>\r\n> .\r\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.Message ID:\r\n> ***@***.***>\r\n>\r\n"

This usually costs money, however there exists a free option today: chatapi.akash.network. This is an openAI api compatible api that runs standard LLMs like llama3.1-405B and llama3.3-70B for free! \r\n\r\nThe official announcement of the public release: https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1814018478845616362 \r\nYou can get your api key here: https://chatapi.akash.network\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a new model provider to the list of model providers\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Any context or related work?\r\nIm a big fan of the work of akash.network and I've been using this service myself for a while now. Its great to have access to bigger models for testing without risking huge token spends on your personal creditcard\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. The env variables are added in the .env.example including the relevant links to where to get the key and how it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nI tested it by following the steps below and got the following result:\r\n<img width=\"391\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 3 35 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e89c34-e8f5-47c3-9ffa-130152d65227\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFollow the test steps below (should be really easy!)\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nEasiest way to test is to do the following:\r\n1. clone repo\r\n2. Go to https://chatapi.akash.network and request a new api key (no email required, optional)\r\n3. run `cp .env.example .env` in the root and set the api key here\r\nhttps://github.com/MbBrainz/eliza/blob/de87bfaa308091ff14ff488f5a446cf72b8904c4/.env.example#L234C1-L238C73 \r\n4. change the model provider in  `./packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to `modelProvider: ModelProviderName.AKASH_CHAT_API,`\r\n5. run `pnpm build & pnpm start`\r\n6. send a msg and verify if the model is akash_chat_api and if it responds\r\n7 \u2705\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nMbBrainz\r\n",

This PR addresses this gap.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added complete prebuild source refactored files\r\n- Maintained file structure as per repository\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified plugin continues to function as expected\r\n- Confirmed build process completes successfully with prebuild files\r\n- No regression in existing functionality\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- This is a maintenance PR to ensure we have complete source control and can properly debug/maintain the plugin\r\n- No functional changes, purely adding source files that should have been included initially\r\n- Follows original plugin structure",

Adding `customSystemPrompt` parameter to generateText function for image gen system prompt\r\n2. Implementing structured prompt engineering for image generation\r\n3. Creating detailed prompt generation guidelines with specific steps\r\n4. Setting up a standardized prompt structure for consistency\r\n5. Adding style-specific prompt customization\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?\r\nTo improve image generation quality by providing structured, detailed prompts that consider key aspects like:\r\n- Main subject focus\r\n- Environment and setting\r\n- Lighting and atmosphere\r\n- Color relationships\r\n- Composition guidelines\r\n- Style integration\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document:\r\n- New `customSystemPrompt` parameter in generateText\r\n- Image prompt structure and guidelines\r\n- Style customization options\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the generateText changes in `packages/core/src/generation.ts`\r\n2. Check the image prompt system in image generation implementation\r\n3. Examine the structured prompt generation workflow\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nI tested locally by running `pnpm start` with a new character that had ModelProviderName.HEURIST as the modelProvider and \"direct\" in the clients. Everything seemed to work well.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps required. Feature is automatically active when using the plugin-image-generation functionality.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\ntao8617\r\n\r\n",

Validate that all references to NodeJS v23 have been updated across the codebase\r\n2. Validate that all CI checks pass\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js v22 using nvm:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    nvm install\r\n    nvm use\r\n    ```\r\n2. Install pnpm:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    npm install -g pnpm@9.4.0\r\n    ```\r\n4. Install dependencies:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pnpm install\r\n    ```\r\n5. Run the test suite to ensure compatibility\r\n6.

This shift will scale message traffic astronomically, analogous to the web\u2019s rise in the 2000s. Just as Cloudflare and https secured web traffic, messaging will need robust scalable end-to-end encrypted messages to protect sensitive information.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks of not using end-to-end encryption for agent interactions exposes the users to what is called as Man in the **Middle Attacks**.\r\n\r\n> **Man in the Middle Attacks**: Intercept requests in between to alter or manipulate data sent or received by the AI service\r\n\r\n- **Phishing**: Messages can be intercepted and manipulated.\r\n- **Privacy**: Sensitive information read by unwanted parties\r\n- **Tampering**: Content can be altered without detection.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> More concrete sensitive data could include credit card details, private keys and passwords which is not yet widely spread but as agents become smarter more use cases will include this type of sharing.\r\n\r\n## XMTP\r\n\r\nEliza agents come with a ready to use client that uses XMTP providing end-to-end encrypted messaging for every agent intereaction, crucial for privacy, security, and compliance provided by the XMTP network.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- **E2EE**: End to end encrypted MLS encryption\r\n- **Multi-agent**: Support multi-agent through group chats\r\n- **Interoperable**: Works across all platforms and frontends\r\n- **Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source\r\n- **Anonymous**: By default every identity is ephemeral and anonymous.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the `xmtp` package\r\n\r\n```bash [cmd]\r\nbun install xmtp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use the `xmtp` package to create an agent and handle messages.\r\n\r\n- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will encrypt all messages and make it available through its public address or ens domain.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { XMTP } from \"xmtp\";\r\n\r\nconst xmtp = new XMTP(onMessage, {\r\n    encryptionKey: WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,\r\n});\r\nawait xmtp.init();\r\nconst onMessage = async (message, user) => {\r\n    console.log(`Decoded message: ${message.content.text} by ${user.address}`);\r\n    // Your AI model response\r\n    await xmtp.send({\r\n        message: response,\r\n        originalMessage: message,\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information visit XMTP [website](https://xmtp.org/)",

You can STILL keep all your keys directly in .env, but if you specify \"SECRET_NAMES\" in your .env, it will pull secrets through that from AWS along with anything in the .env\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create an AWS account. Free-tier is enough. \r\n2. In Secrets Manager, create a secret named \"secret/myagentname\" (this can be named anything but this format is nice). \r\n3.

Any context or related work?\r\nJust think it is more secure to pull from secrets manager, especially if people are hosting their agent on AWS, but this will work even if you host elsewhere as long as you have the a service role with secrets manager access specified in the \"AWS_ROLE_ARN\".\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMaybe just an explainer that Secrets Manager is useable with Eliza.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb09a61-fb4e-457a-8209-9eb7e6d53eca)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddcd2b7-8fce-4e0c-8c90-a25af4ce5d3f)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a286a34-b560-4adb-b633-acb6a1209969)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd96be74-4966-41a2-babc-7e4c625bdbbe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166014ea-9185-4bb0-b2d7-433c5ac50e25)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nTake a look at settings.ts in the core package. \r\n\r\n### Discord Username\r\n\r\nropirito",

Trump says silly offensive stuff, and we wanted to capture that. He would not say SARS-COVID-19. I disagree with about 99% of the stuff he says, and 99% of the stuff his character file says. That being said, I care about art, and not letting art be compromised by politics.\r\n\r\nWe love people all over the world, and personally I will be visiting China in a couple days to meet everyone. I don't believe that we should be against any group for their nationality. But we shouldn't kill the comedy and make our characters worse-- that's why OpenAI's models suck now. It's a slippery slope that will reduce bravery, integrity and quality."

Users looking for open-source AI solutions that prioritize privacy and uncensored interactions currently have limited options within the framework.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd Venice AI provider integration to Eliza framework. Venice is a privacy-focused alternative that utilizes leading open-source AI technology to deliver uncensored, unbiased machine intelligence while preserving user privacy.\r\n\r\nImplementation would include:\r\n- Support for Venice's privacy-preserving API endpoints\r\n- Configuration for Venice API key\r\n- Documentation for privacy-focused setup\r\n- Example .env config\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Using existing mainstream providers (but these often come with privacy and censorship concerns)\r\n- Using Local Llama\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nVenice's focus on privacy and uncensored AI aligns well with users who need more control over their AI interactions while maintaining data privacy. This integration would expand Eliza's capabilities to serve privacy-conscious users and those seeking unrestricted AI interactions.\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMany image generation services such as FAL, Stable Diffusion, etc. have \"safety checkers\" that ensure prompts are appropriate.\r\nThese have several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Additional latency: These checks are done via an LLM, which can add unnecessary latency.\r\n2. Unpredictable / incorrect outputs: Since the checks use LLMs, their output can be overly restrictive or random, causing unpredictable behavior.\r\n3. Not necessary: Some use cases don't require the safety checker.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we at [daojones.ai](daojones.ai) ([@DAOJonesPumpAI](x.com/DAOJonesPumpAI) on X.com) have found this is overly restrictive and have written a custom image generation application that disables it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe want to set the FAL configuration for our image requests.\r\nWe need to set `enable_safety_checker` to `false` while also setting `safety_tolerance` to `6` (the most tolerant setting).\r\nSince these options are not uniformly supported by the different APIs, we will just add an \"escape hatch\" configuration `imageSettings.fal`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Turning safety checker off globally: This would work for our use case but could be a breaking change for other use cases.\r\n2. Adding a global `allowNsfw` flag: This requires reconciling this with other APIs and determining what settings it would correspond to.\r\n3. Adding the `enableSafetyChecker` / `safetyTolerance` flags at the top level of `imageSettings`: this would pollute the global namespace.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",

The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",

The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, we observed issues with aixbt, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

Old fallback logic (Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local) if neither is configured.\r\n- For example, in your `character.json`, you can specify:\r\n  ```json5\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  If you have `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set, the service will use Deepgram; otherwise it continues to the next check.\r\n- `processQueue()` uses a `switch` on `this.transcriptionProvider` to pick the final method (`transcribeWithDeepgram`, `transcribeWithOpenAI`, or `transcribeLocally`).\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   - If no Space is running, possibly launch one by `shouldLaunchSpace()` (random chance, business hours, cooldown).  \r\n   - If a Space is running, `manageCurrentSpace()` handles speaker timeouts, occupancy updates, queue acceptance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - Generates a `SpaceConfig` (topics from config or GPT).  \r\n   - Attaches plugins: audio recording, STT/TTS, idle monitor, etc.  \r\n   - Hooks into `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - Maintains an `activeSpeakers` array + a queue if at capacity (`maxSpeakers`).  \r\n   - Enforces `speakerMaxDurationMs` per speaker.  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed, accept next in queue if available.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs completion, clears states, etc.  \r\n   - Resumes periodic checks at a slower interval until the next launch is decided.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Transcription Provider\r\nTRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=         # Default is local (possible values: deepgram, openai, local)\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) `character.json` \u2192 `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n  }\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: number of concurrent speakers allowed.\r\n- **`topics`**: if none are provided, GPT generates them dynamically.\r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check cycle to spawn a new Space.\r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: maximum time each speaker can speak before removal.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features** (new Twitter Spaces integration and optional transcription provider).\r\n- **Improvements** (unified plugin development, more config options, fallback logic maintained).\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, minimal. We must mention:\r\n- The new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (optional).\r\n- The new `twitterSpaces` config section in `character.json`.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Check `transcription.service.ts` to review how it resolves conflicts by prioritizing character settings, then `.env`, then old fallback.\r\n- Check new or relocated Twitter Spaces integration files for the Space lifecycle (launch, speaker management, idle detection, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Define `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (or leave it empty to keep old fallback).\r\n2. Provide valid API keys if choosing `deepgram` or `openai`.\r\n3. Define `twitterSpaces.randomChance` in the character JSON to `1` (for a 100% rate of starting a space).\r\n4. Run the agent; verify that Spaces launch automatically, respect the chosen transcription provider, and handle multi-speaker logic as expected.\r\n\r\nNo special database migrations are needed. Basic local runs and logs confirm correct functioning.\r\n\r\n# Future Improvements\r\n\r\n- **More robust decision logic** for accepting speakers, switching, and timeouts.  \r\n- **Realtime API plugin** for smoother, on-the-fly conversation handling.  \r\n- **Solo Broadcast Mode**: launch Spaces focused on a single host monologue with no external speakers.  \r\n- **True VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to detect when a speaker finishes talking, instead of relying on manual mute/unmute cues.  \r\n- **Advanced scheduling triggers** (e.g., event-based or calendar-based).  \r\n- **Analytics & insights** for post-Space summaries or usage metrics.\r\n\r\n---",

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.  I know there is alot of interest in the memory system as well so as part of the core it should be as clear as possible IMHO."

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) logging and enables the Eliza application to run within Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions).\r\n\r\nAs Eliza is a fully autonomous AI agent capable of running within a TEE, we need to demonstrate to the outside world that we are indeed operating within a TEE. This allows external parties to verify that our actions are protected by the TEE and that they are entirely executed by Eliza, without any third-party interference. Therefore, it is necessary to leverage TEE's remote attestation and establish a TEE logging mechanism to prove that these operations are entirely and autonomously performed by Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the existing plugin-tee only supports running Eliza in dstack TDX CVM. However, although TDX is more convenient to use, Intel SGX remains a highly popular TEE in production environments. With the help of Gramine LibOS, it is possible to support running Eliza in SGX, thereby enabling the deployment of Eliza in a broader range of TEE scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n1. Support running Eliza in SGX\r\n2. Add plugin-sgx to support SGX attestation \r\n3. Add plugin-tee-log to support TEE logging (Gramine SGX and Dstack TDX)\r\n4. Add REST API in client-direct to support retrieve TEE logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n## TEE Logging Mechanism:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Key Pair Generation and Attestation**:\r\n   - During startup, each agent generates a key pair and creates a remote attestation for the public key. The private key is securely stored in the TEE's encrypted memory. The agent's relevant information, along with the public key and attestation, is recorded in a local database. A new key pair is generated each time the agent is updated or restarted to ensure key security.\r\n\r\n2. **Log Recording**:\r\n   - For each log entry, basic information is recorded, including `agentId`, `roomId`, `userId`, `type`, `content`, and `timestamp`. This information is concatenated and signed using the agent's corresponding private key to ensure verifiability. The verification process follows this trust chain:\r\n     - Verify the attestation.\r\n     - Trust the public key contained in the attestation.\r\n     - Use the public key to verify the signature.\r\n     - Trust the complete log record.\r\n\r\n3. **Data Storage**:\r\n   - All log data must be stored in the TEE's encrypted file system in production environments. Storing data in plaintext is prohibited to prevent tampering.\r\n\r\n4. **Log Extraction for Verification**:\r\n   - Third parties can extract TEE logs for verification purposes. Two types of information can be extracted:\r\n     - **Agent Information**: This includes the agent's metadata, public key, and attestation, which can be used to verify the agent's public key.\r\n     - **Log Information**: Required logs can be extracted, with the agent's attestation and public key used to verify the signature, ensuring that each record remains untampered.\r\n\r\n5. **Integrity Protection**:\r\n   - When users extract TEE logs via the REST API, the results are hashed, and an attestation is generated. After extraction, users can verify the attestation by comparing the hash value contained within it to the extracted results, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to add new documentation about TEE logging and how to run Eliza in SGX\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. SGX Gramine support\r\n2. plugin-sgx\r\n3. plugin-tee-log\r\n4. other parts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Test SGX support\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare the SGX environment and install the Gramine dependencies according to https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\r\n\r\nThen, start eliza in SGX:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm i\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Start default character\r\nSGX=1 make start\r\n# Start specific character\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/trump.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test TEE logging\r\n\r\nTo get started, prepare the TEE environment. Both dstack TDX and Gramine SGX are supported.\r\n\r\nNext, enable TEE logging by configuring the .env file:\r\n```\r\nENABLE_TEE_LOG=true \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logging isn't integrated for actions by default, you need to integrate the logging for the actions you want to log. For example, if you want to log the `Continue` action of plugin-bootstrap, you can do the following:\r\n\r\nFirst, add plugin-tee-log to the dependencies of plugin-bootstrap:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"@elizaos/plugin-tee-log\": \"workspace:*\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, add the following code to the `Continue` action:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport {\r\n    ServiceType,\r\n    ITeeLogService,\r\n} from \"@elizaos/core\";\r\n\r\n\r\n// In the handler of the action\r\n    handler: async (\r\n        runtime: IAgentRuntime,\r\n        message: Memory,\r\n        state: State,\r\n        options: any,\r\n        callback: HandlerCallback\r\n    ) => {\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n\r\n        // Log the action\r\n        const teeLogService = runtime\r\n            .getService<ITeeLogService>(ServiceType.TEE_LOG)\r\n            .getInstance();\r\n        if (teeLogService.log(\r\n                runtime.agentId,\r\n                message.roomId,\r\n                message.userId,\r\n                \"The type of the log, for example, Action:CONTINUE\",\r\n                \"The content that you want to log\"\r\n            )\r\n        ) {\r\n            console.log(\"Logged TEE log successfully\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Continue the action\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

This error can be resolved by simply running the build command again. However, this is an issue that needs to be addressed later.\r\n\r\nOther than that, everything worked smoothly during the test. If you encounter any other issues while following these steps, please feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently, I have set the SGX EPC size (memory size) to 64 GB in the Gramine manifest. In reality, Eliza itself does not require this much memory. However, some dependencies of Eliza rely on WebAssembly (WASM), and initializing WASM demands a significant amount of memory. If the memory is insufficient, you may encounter the following error:\r\n\r\n`RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: Cannot allocate Wasm memory for a new instance.`\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this issue, I configured the enclave size to 64 GB. This is a temporary workaround, and we need to optimize WASM memory usage in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare a SGX enabled machine.\r\n\r\nThen, you can use the following command to start a Gramine Docker container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo docker run -it --name eliza_sgx \\\r\n    --mount type=bind,source={your_eliza_path},target=/root/eliza \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/enclave \\\r\n    --device /dev/sgx/provision \\\r\n    gramineproject/gramine:stable-jammy\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter entering the docker, you can use the following command to prepare the Eliza environment:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Generate the private key for signing the SGX enclave\r\ngramine-sgx-gen-private-key\r\n\r\ncd /root/eliza/\r\n\r\n# Install nodejs and pnpm\r\n# Node.js will be installed at `/usr/bin/node`.\r\n# Gramine will utilize this path as the default Node.js location to run Eliza.\r\n# If you prefer to use nvm for installing Node.js, please ensure to specify the Node.js path in the Makefile, as the installation path for nvm is not `/usr/bin/node`.\r\napt update\r\napt install -y build-essential\r\napt install -y curl\r\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_23.x | bash -\r\napt install -y nodejs=23.3.0-1nodesource1\r\nnpm install -g pnpm\r\n\r\n# Build Eliza\r\npnpm i\r\n# The build may fail on the first attempt due to the missing `plugin-tee` dependency in `plugin-tee-log`. Simply run the build command again to resolve the issue.\r\n# TODO: fix the build issue\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Copy the .env.example file to .env\r\ncp .env.example .env\r\n# Edit the .env file\r\n\r\n# Start Eliza in SGX\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/c3po.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n"

This could cause pre-existing embeddings and new embeddings to be incompatible.\r\n\r\nI removed `isOllama` flag from the config.

It is technically a change in behavior because using ollama with a url override will no longer strip the trailing v1/.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdded support for environment variables:\r\n- USE_VOYAGEAI_EMBEDDING\r\n- VOYAGEAI_API_KEY\r\n- VOYAGEAI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS\r\n- VOYAGEAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL Configuration follows existing patterns.

            "body": "Title: Standardize boolean values and fix pattern for .env file\r\n\r\nDescribe the bug\r\nThe `.env` file contains some inconsistencies in how boolean values and specific strings are represented. For instance, the variable `POST_IMMEDIATELY` uses the string \"NO\", while a boolean value like `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE` uses `false`. This inconsistency could lead to parsing issues and is prone to human error. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n1. Open the `.env` file. 2. Observe that `POST_IMMEDIATELY=NO` is used instead of the expected `false`. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n Boolean variables should consistently use `true` or `false`, and all string-based boolean values such as `POST_IMMEDIATELY` should use `true`/`false` instead of `\"YES\"`/`\"NO\"`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\n This change will standardize boolean values, making the `.env` file easier to parse and reducing the risk of errors. The `parseBooleanFromText` function, declared as `const parseBooleanFromText: (text: string) => boolean;`, can be used outside the `.env` context to ensure boolean parsing is consistent across the codebase. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for .env values\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean values**: Always use `true` or `false` (not `\"YES\"` or `\"NO\"`). \r\nExample: ``` TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true POST_IMMEDIATELY=false ``` \r\n\r\n Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and make it easier for automated scripts to process the `.env` file while reduce  human error.",

Any stored references or comparisons to old UUIDs will no longer match.\r\n\r\n### Risks & Impact\r\n\r\n- **Risk**: Existing code/data relying on old UUIDs may break or create duplicates.\r\n- **Mitigation**: We can choose to:\r\n    1. Merge only the **tests** for now, keeping the existing UUID generation.\r\n    2. Merge the bit fix (and re-key), but accept the breaking change or plan a migration.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. **(Option A)** Merge only the tests and skip the version-bit fix for now (to avoid re-keying).\r\n2. **(Option B)** Merge both tests and fix, but coordinate any needed data migration or accept re-keying.",

Assuming ~400 ms blocktimes, this amounts to 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

            "body": "_sup fam, today i put in a few hours to extend the Eliza framework by adding some core trading functionality for on-chain solana bots. my focus was to create a set of tools that will allow agents to execute trades, manage risk, and pull critical data. here's what I added and worked on:_\r\n\r\n**What I Added/Completed Today:**\r\n\r\n1. nice_funcs.py:\r\n\r\n- Added a library of helpful functions tailored for Solana on-chain trading.\r\n- Functions now include position management, wallet holdings fetching, and other utilities to make trading more efficient.\r\n- This has been tested with my personal bots but should integrate well with Eliza\u2019s architecture.\r\n\r\n2. bot.py:\r\n\r\n- Built a script that allows agents to perform trading actions such as:\r\n- Closing a position (action 0).\r\n- Opening a position (action 1).\r\n- Adding stop-loss logic (action 2).\r\n- Implementing breakout trades (action 3).\r\n- Market-making logic (action 5).\r\n- Currently, it uses basic user input to decide the action, but this will soon be fully bot-driven.\r\n\r\n3. get_ohlcv_data.py\r\n\r\n- this allows the agent to get open, high, low, close and volume data\r\n- also have moving averages and examples of other technical indicators\r\n\r\n4. dontshare.py (ignored):\r\n\r\n- Added placeholders for sensitive information such as:\r\n- Solana private keys.\r\n- BirdEye API keys.\r\n- RPC URLs.\r\n- Added this file to .gitignore to ensure it doesn\u2019t get accidentally pushed.\r\n\r\n5. Updated README.md:\r\n\r\n- Wrote a comprehensive README to document how to use these new tools and scripts.\r\n- It includes detailed steps for configuration, usage, and what each action/script does.\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Why This Matters:**\r\n\r\n- These tools lay the groundwork for enabling AI agents to perform advanced trading strategies directly on-chain.\r\n- The added functionality simplifies interaction with Solana contracts while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.\r\n- It ensures agents can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention\u2014just plug in the strategy, and they're good to go.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?**\r\n\r\n- I'm researching the best way to transition from Python to TypeScript or add a shell for TS compatibility, depending on the project direction.\r\n- Planning to integrate more trading actions like:\r\n- Funding buys (action 6).\r\n- Liquidation monitoring (action 7).\r\n- Always happy to hear feedback on how this integrates with Eliza\u2019s current architecture and if there are specific improvements to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute. Let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like me to adjust or refine for tomorrow.",

This PR adds support for Eliza to interact with the Treasure mainnet, with logic/implementation borrowed from #1225 and #1128.\r\n\r\nInitially, only the `transfer` function has been supported with additional features to come to hook into the Treasure Development Kit (TDK), Magicswap, and other Treasure platform features.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nSpin up an agent with the `treasure` plugin + review `plugin-treasure`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. In `.env`, should set the value for `TREASURE_ADDRESS` (public address for the agent account), `TREASURE_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account), and `TREASURE_RPC_URL` as https://rpc.treasure.lol.\r\nTo test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. [Treasure Bridge](https://bridge.treasure.lol/) can be used to bridge MAGIC directly from `arb1` to an address on `treasure`.\r\n2. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"Send 0.1 MAGIC to \" - e.g. \"send 0.1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\"\r\n3. Assuming you had 1 MAGIC to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. \"Successfully sent 1 MAGIC to 0x7A6a48b8e7BD3451Fc57f01Ad9Aaea62cdf5956E\r\nTransaction: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"\r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Treasure Block Explorer (https://treasurescan.io/)",

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in `plugin-avail`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- In `.env` you should set the value for `AVAIL_ADDRESS` (this is the public address for the agent account) and `AVAIL_SEED` (seed phrase for the same account).\r\n- **Transfer AVAIL**\r\n    - To test transfer function, you need tokens in your Avail account. On testnet, you can use the [Avail Faucet](https://faucet.avail.tools/). If you need more please ping me, and I can send it over. \r\n    - Run the agent and prompt it with: \"send 1 AVAIL to <any other Avail account> \" - e.g. `send 1 AVAIL to 5GWbvXjefEvXXETtKQH7YBsUaPc379KAQATW1eqeJT26cbsK`\r\n    - Assuming everything goes smoothly the agent returns with the Tx Hash, and Block Hash. \r\nThe tx hash can be checked on the Avail block explorer at https://avail-turing.subscan.io/\r\n- **Submit Data**\r\n    - To test data submission,  you need tokens in your Avail account to pay fees. On testnet, you can use the [Avail Faucet](https://faucet.avail.tools/). If you need more please ping me, and I can send it over. \r\n    - Run the agent and prompt it with: \"Submit the following data to Avail <DATA>\" - e.g. `Submit the following data to Avail \"Hello World!\"`\r\n    - Assuming everything goes smoothly the agent returns with the Tx Hash, and Block Hash. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nRobinRRT\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "# Pull Request: Integrate Deva into Eliza\r\n\r\n## Relates to\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new [Deva](https://www.deva.me/) client integration for the Eliza AI agent, enabling posting and scheduling posts to the [Deva](https://www.deva.me/) feed.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n- **Minimal Risk**: This integration is additive and does not alter existing functionalities of Eliza.\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Introduces a new dependency on Deva's API, which requires monitoring for future updates or changes.\r\n- **Data Privacy**: Ensures that any data shared between Eliza and Deva complies with our privacy policies.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the capability to post and schedule content directly to the [Deva platform](https://www.deva.me/) from the Eliza AI agent. Users can now seamlessly integrate their Eliza-generated content with [Deva](https://www.deva.me/), enhancing their content distribution and engagement strategies.\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Feature**: This is a non-breaking change that adds new functionality to the Eliza AI agent by integrating with Deva\u2019s API for posting and scheduling content.\r\n\r\n## Documentation Changes Needed?\r\n\r\nNot at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Create a Deva Account**\r\n    - Navigate to [deva.me](https://www.deva.me/), create an account, and press the \"Get Started\" button in the top right.\r\n    - ![Get Started](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31ebe01-3ee7-40f5-8e30-f59c79c642fe)\r\n\r\n2. **Complete Onboarding**\r\n    - Click through the onboarding screens and connect your preferred social account (e.g., Twitter) to Deva.\r\n\r\n3. **Access the Deva Feed**\r\n    - You can now see the Deva feed, where you can post and interact with other Devas.\r\n    - <img width=\"1462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a95b6e-779a-4864-b37c-5a848bde4c52\" />\r\n\r\n4. **Create an Application to get the token**\r\n    - At this point, you'll be able to get a token to interact with Deva, to do so: \r\n        - Navigate to Apps chapter in settings by clicking the user icon in top right corner and then settings -> Apps, or opening [apps](https://www.deva.me/settings/apps)\r\n        - Press Apps and Session\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fda36ac-3675-4f30-8c48-9b91e71a741e)\r\n        - Press Create new app\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fc9b04-510e-4a90-876c-e4f6d2e562d7)\r\n        - You are redirected to the form of the app creation, Name, Redirect URL and descriptions are necessary fields. Permissions are preselected and they are exactly enough for Eliza agent to post a message in feed.\r\n        - After creating an app, select it from the list of apps;\r\n        - Inside you will find a Get Token button, to generate a new token for your app:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307ab088-0508-496e-bc8e-4ded833e8b4f)\r\n        - Later, it'll be visible in the list:\r\n          <br/>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39034c0d-3cf3-4a69-aaab-8cd1740d9ba6)\r\n\r\n5. **Update Environment Variables**\r\n    - Once you have the token, update the environment variables in the `.env` file:\r\n      ```env\r\n      DEVA_API_KEY=YourApiKey\r\n      DEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deva.me # Production API URL\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n6. **Select Deva Client as Default Character**\r\n    - Select the Deva client as Eliza's default character and choose the desired model:\r\n      <br/>![Select Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1120ebb4-4618-4364-bbf8-7040b6bda8c0)\r\n\r\n7. **Run the Application**\r\n    - Execute the following commands to install dependencies and start the application:\r\n      ```bash\r\n      pnpm install && pnpm start\r\n      ```\r\n    - This will initiate the Deva client:\r\n      <br/>![Initiate Deva Client](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef64f0b-c2c1-4a4b-a6b5-0461433af022)\r\n    - Fetch the persona associated with your agent and the posts that you have pushed to the Deva feed:\r\n      <br/>![Fetch Persona and Posts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a698b06-b616-47cc-8318-355a91cc424c)\r\n    - Once done, Eliza will post one message to the Deva feed immediately and schedule another one as a test message:\r\n      <br/>![Post Messages](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/523d69f4-1f3f-4d49-82a1-163e3cd4d128)\r\n8. **Eliza agent's post is in the feed!**\r\n   - <img width=\"621\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bd7cd5-7e3a-4c64-9597-9b0909642189\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Staging Environment Testing\r\n\r\nTo avoid populating the production Deva feed, you can perform the same flow in the [staging environment](https://staging.deva.me/). Ensure you update the related environment variable:\r\n\r\n```env\r\nDEVA_API_BASE_URL=https://api-staging.deva.me # Staging API URL\r\n",

            "body": "## Description\r\nWhile setting up Discord bots with multiple characters, I encountered and resolved an issue with Discord token resolution. This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes. ",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR enhances the composeContext function by integrating Handlebars as an optional templating engine. Users can now choose between simple key replacement or advanced template features provided by Handlebars, such as conditionals and loops.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature: Adds a new functionality to support Handlebars templating engine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this?

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in context.ts and the newly added tests in context.test.ts.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Run the tests in context.test.ts to verify both the simple string replacement and Handlebars functionality.\r\n- Ensure all scenarios, including edge cases like missing values and advanced Handlebars templates, are covered by tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Built to support twitter for now.\r\n\r\nLeverages Privy as the account repository and Privy import feature to add users social account. This creates a wallet on behalf of the user that they can claim by logging in with twitter on that Privy instance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the data source could be replaced with an onchain social registry that anyone can opt into themselves to link their socials to a wallet, using TEE-verified oauth. With a reserve vault smart contract layer on top of that, this could hold tokens sent to users that haven't signed up yet and then easily be claimed on signup.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nTo enable agents to send tokens directly to twitter handles without having to know the users wallet address. This could spark entirely new forms of meta games, stories, and economies.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61408862-0a18-4e8e-a656-914dc83f8ee0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff281c-a152-4f57-8af7-77296e764009)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9b75c4-f29c-4c7f-8f70-70e44770afb4)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`/packages/plugin-social-wallets`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n- PRIVY_APP_ID\r\n- PRIVY_APP_SECRET\r\n- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n- TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n- TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n- TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n\r\nRun `sh ./scripts/start.sh`\r\nAsk agent `send 0.001 ETH to @<twitter_username>`\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made to plugin-evm that triggers the TX flow. Last time we tested, that plugin was giving us some issues and we had to resolve them to get the plugin to trigger.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@djdabs_\r\n",

Any context or related work?\r\nSimplifies the codebase for future maintenance and readability. Even within the two actions, `SwapAction` and `BridgeAction`, we observe that the constructor has unequal parameters for `createConfig` despite attempting to achieve the same outcome. While this difference does not affect the current implementation, it could lead to some different behaviors in the future, so it's better to inherit a single base class that unifies the LiFi SDK config parameters.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixes passing in an invalid config to `executeRoute`.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

I'd like to improve the `state` to also take into account memories and previous messages so that the user can have a conversation with the agent, instead of having to pass all the information on one message. The thing is that when I've passed the whole `state` I got answers that were really related to the personality of the `character`, and I got answers that refused to help like \"I'm not here to do that\". \r\nHow can I incorporate the `state`'s memory without the personality of the `character` to gather the parameters for my `action`?"

Added core ERC-20 functionality:\r\n   - Added ERC-20 ABI and contract interactions\r\n   - Implemented token balance checking\r\n   - Added support for token transfers\r\n\r\n2. Implemented new actions:\r\n   - `getBalance`: Check ETH/token balances across chains\r\n   - `transfer`: Native token and ERC-20 transfers\r\n   - Enhanced `bridge`: Cross-chain token bridging via LiFi\r\n   - Enhanced `swap`: DEX token swaps \r\n   - via LiFi aggregation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"745\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 7 10 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6ad6ba-6338-43d9-a234-5059f3fa144c\">\r\n\r\n3. Fixed type safety issues and improved error handling\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core wallet functionality could impact transaction signing\r\n- Updates to bridge/swap logic could affect cross-chain operations\r\n- ERC-20 integration adds complexity to token handling\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the core changes in:\r\n   - `src/actions/bridge.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/swap.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/transfer.ts`\r\n   - `src/actions/getbalance.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Check test implementation:\r\n   - `test/setup.ts` - Test infrastructure\r\n   - `test/actions/bridge.test.ts` - Bridge action tests\r\n   - `test/providers/wallet.test.ts` - Wallet provider tests\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test basic ETH operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n\r\n// Transfer ETH\r\nawait transferAction.handler(runtime, message, state);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test ERC-20 operations:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Check USDC balance\r\nawait getbalanceAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  chain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Bridge tokens\r\nawait bridgeAction.handler(runtime, {\r\n  fromChain: \"ethereum\",\r\n  toChain: \"base\",\r\n  amount: \"100\",\r\n  tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation updates needed for:\r\n- New ERC-20 functionality\r\n- Updated action parameters\r\n- Testing setup and mocking\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- Requires environment variables:\r\n  - `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (optional, for token verification)\r\n- Dependencies on LiFi SDK and viem need to be properly versioned\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to: #735",

            "body": "# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a plugin that makes Eliza verifiable through the use of TEEs. The plugin leverages the [Marlin Oyster](https://docs.marlin.org/user-guides/oyster/) platform and [SDKs](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo). More concretely, it adds an action that lets Eliza respond with remote attestations when asked. It is expected to be followed up with additional PRs for other aspects as well.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nIt's important for AI agents to be verifiable in Web3 so users can verify behaviors and responses of an agent they are interacting with. A performant way of accomplishing this is running the agent in a TEE and providing remote attestation infrastructure for verification by users. Additionally, TEEs provide privacy protections to users' interactions with agents.\r\n\r\nIt is similar in spirit to `plugin-tee` but targets the Marlin Oyster stack instead.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes. A section on the plugin has been added.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe README of the plugin. It specifies the `.env` settings as well as how to run a mock attestation server for local testing.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Run the mock attestation server, simplest way is docker - `docker run --init --rm -p 1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mock`\r\n2. Set configs corresponding to the plugin, just `TEE_MARLIN=yes` should suffice.\r\n3. Chat with Eliza and ask for a remote attestation, I have tried various phrasings like \"attest yourself\", \"get me a remote attestation\", etc which seem to work.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`roshanroshan`",

This is similar conceptually to these plugins (e.g. `plugin-solana` and others)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis plugin follows the standards set by other crypto integrations, including things like the `SEND_TOKENS` action. Changes to the overall project documentation don't seem to be required.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in `plugin-zksync-era`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. In `.env` you should set the value for `ZKSYNC_ADDRESS` (this is the public address for the agent account) and `ZKSYNC_PRIVATE_KEY` (private key for the same account).\r\n2. To test the transfer function properly, this address needs tokens. Coinbase can be used to send ZK directly to an address on ZKsync Era, but I am also happy to provide tokens for reviewers (I'll send ZK tokens to reviewers that need it). \r\n3. Run the agent and prompt it with: \"send 0.5 ZK to <an address on ZKsync Era>\" - e.g. \"send 1 ZK to 0xee0c40F86544a8b0616BC827728f714a8B4cEeE7\"\r\n4. Assuming you had 1 ZK to send, the agent will confirm and respond with the tx hash, e.g. `Transfer completed successfully! \"tx: 0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\"`\r\n5. The tx hash can be checked on the ZKsync block explorer at https://explorer.zksync.io, e.g. https://explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x45759cf3e76d26610154a094c87572fbd7f5ef909f62c4ea13f7defb0d87cf0b\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nanthonykrose\r\n",

            "body": "# Relates to:\r\nN/A - Improvement to model selection functionality\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Changes only affect how model class is selected, with fallback to default values\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nUpdates model class selection to respect character configuration settings instead of using hardcoded values. This allows characters to use different model sizes without code changes.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix (allows existing config file settings to be implemented as indicated in the [documentation](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/guides/configuration/#model-providers))\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nChanges to code line references and a README note for Apple Silicon users\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFiles changed:\r\n1. `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in direct message handling\r\n2. `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts` - Updated model selection in Discord message handling\r\n3. `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` - Updated model selection in Telegram message handling\r\n4. `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts` - Updated model selection in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n5. `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts` - Updated model selection in continue action\r\n\r\nThe key change in each file is replacing hardcoded `ModelClass.SMALL` with:\r\n````typescript\r\nmodelClass: runtime.character.settings?.model || ModelClass.SMALL,\r\n````\r\nThis ensures consistent model selection across all client types while maintaining the small model as a fallback.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a character config with model setting:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"model\": \"medium\",\r\n        \"temperature\": 0.45\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start agent with character config:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --character=\"path/to/character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify in logs that responses use the configured model:\r\n```\r\nGenerating text with options: \r\n{\"modelProvider\":\"openai\",\"model\":\"medium\"}\r\n\r\nSelected model: \r\ngpt-4o\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Test with different model settings (\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\") to verify proper model selection\r\n\r\nFiles changed:\r\n- `packages/client-direct/src/index.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in direct message handling\r\n- `packages/client-discord/src/messages.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Discord message handling\r\n- `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` and `packages/client-telegram/src/messageManager.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Telegram message handling\r\n- `packages/client-farcaster/src/interactions.ts`\r\n  - Updated `generateMessageResponse()` to use character model settings in Farcaster interaction handling\r\n- `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/continue.ts`\r\n  - Modified model selection in CONTINUE action to use character settings\r\n  - Updated both `generateMessageResponse()` and `generateTrueOrFalse()` calls\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard build process:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo database changes or special deployment instructions needed.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@seanbhart\r\n",

Review the `getCloudflareGatewayBaseURL` function in `generation.ts`\r\n2. Check gateway integration in provider handlers\r\n3. Verify documentation clarity in `configuration.md`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure Cloudflare AI Gateway:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_GW_ENABLED=true\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_ID=your-gateway-id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Test with different providers:\r\n   - Verify OpenAI requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Anthropic requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Groq requests route through gateway\r\n\r\n3. Test fallback behavior:\r\n   - Disable gateway and verify direct API calls\r\n   - Use invalid configuration and verify fallback\r\n   - Check logging messages for debugging info\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n- When gateway is properly configured:\r\n  - Requests route through Cloudflare\r\n  - Logs show gateway URL being used\r\n  - Response handling remains unchanged\r\n\r\n- When gateway is disabled/misconfigured:\r\n  - Fallback to direct API calls\r\n  - Warning logs indicate configuration issues\r\n  - Service continues to function normally\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nw3_bounty",

                "body": "Investigation Summary:\r\n\r\n    PostgresDatabaseAdapter Initialization:\r\n        The PostgresDatabaseAdapter class in packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts is responsible for managing the PostgreSQL database connection and operations. It includes methods for initializing the database, handling errors, and executing queries.\r\n\r\n    Schema Initialization:\r\n        During the init method, the adapter checks if certain tables exist and attempts to initialize the schema by executing SQL scripts. This is where the extension setup might be happening.\r\n\r\n    Potential Issue:\r\n        If the vector extension is being created in the schema initialization process and it already exists, it would lead to the duplicate key error you're seeing.\r\n\r\nRecommended Steps:\r\n\r\n    Check Schema Files:\r\n        Review the schema.sql file in the adapter-postgres package to see if there are any CREATE EXTENSION commands for the vector extension. Ensure that these commands are wrapped in a conditional check to prevent re-creation if the extension already exists.\r\n\r\n    Modify Initialization Logic:\r\n        Update the initialization logic to check for the existence of the extension before attempting to create it. This can be done using a query like:\r\n\r\n        DO $$ BEGIN\r\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector') THEN\r\n                CREATE EXTENSION vector;\r\n            END IF;\r\n        END $$;\r\n\r\n    Database Cleanup:\r\n        As a temporary workaround, manually drop the vector extension from your database and let the initialization process recreate it. Use the following command in your PostgreSQL database:\r\n\r\n        DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS vector;\r\n\r\n"

This occurs when using plugin-image-generation to generating images as well. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce using the ImageGenerationPlugin:\r\n\r\nEnable the twitter client for your character along with an appropriate API key for image generation. Reply to a post of the Agent on twitter with \"Please generate an image of a cute cat!\" - it should trigger the GENERATE_IMAGE action.

We believe that adding this as a plugin will significantly improve Eliza's capabilities to perform research and Q&A.\r\n\r\n# Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA Plugin for FerePro in Eliza's codebase.\r\n\r\n# Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs an alternate, we will need to add a lot of tools and multi agentic capabilities to Eliza. FerePro can abstract all of that. \r\nDisclaimer: I'm a co founder and core dev at FereAI.\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n1. FerePro APIs can provide streaming answer as well as non streaming answer. This plugin must support both the use cases.\r\n2. FerePro APIs also provide a bunch of intermediate responses. This is usually shown in UI for users to get a view of happenings behind the scenes. They should only be enabled when this plugin is run in debug mode. Developers can use this info to troubleshoot or get support from Fere team.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n1. Developers will need to [get API keys from FereAI](https://docs.fereai.xyz/docs/api/api_access). \r\n3. This key must be passed to the plugin for it to work.\r\n4. FerePro is a freemium API. There is a limit on questions that can be asked for free. (We can revise the limits based on community feedback). For extended use cases, the developers must top up their account by visiting fereai.xyz.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen defining a `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` in a character\u2019s JSON configuration file, the code attempts to invoke it as a function with `(validTargetUsersStr)`. Since JSON cannot store JavaScript functions, this causes runtime errors. Other templates like `twitterMessageHandlerTemplate` and `twitterPostTemplate` are handled purely as strings, so they work fine. The inconsistency leads to broken response generation when a JSON-defined `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` is present.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. **Create a character JSON file** (e.g., `adam.character.json`) that includes:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"your-character-name\",\r\n        \"clients\": [\"telegram\", \"twitter\"],\r\n        \"modelProvider\": \"openai\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"secrets\": {\r\n                \"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\": \"your_telegram_bot_token\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"user\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"email@proton.me\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"your_twitter_password\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_COOKIES\": \"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"auth_token\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_auth_token\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"ct0\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_ct0_value\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"guest_id\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"v1%3A173451270913595996\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}]\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"user1,user2\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"plugins\": [\r\n            \"@ai16z/plugin-your-custom-plugin\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"templates\": {\r\n            \"twitterPostTemplate\": \"# Areas of Expertise\\n{{knowledge}}\\n\\n# About {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}):\\n{{bio}}\\n{{lore}}\\n{{topics}}\\n\\n{{providers}}\\n\\n{{characterPostExamples}}\\n\\n{{postDirections}}\\n\\n# Task: Generate a post in the voice and style and perspective of {{agentName}} @{{twitterUserName}}.\\nWrite a 1-3 sentence post that is {{adjective}} about {{topic}} (without mentioning {{topic}} directly), from the perspective of {{agentName}}.

Login works, posting works, it just seems that the cookies should work to not trigger new logins each time. Guessing at some point Twitter will flag continuous logins like this. If I don't add cookies at all, same thing, it works, but triggers a login alert email each time.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSimply starting Eliza with Twitter credentials added + manual cookies. They do get cached in the db, but on restart, it still doesn't consider itself logged in and I get an email.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nStay logged in.

            "body": "Hey Guys! \r\n\r\nWe are attempting to enable the Eliza AI bot to post tweets using the agent-twitter-client setup as described in the Eliza documentation. We have the bot running smoothly via Telegram and the character are starting to behave exactly as wanted. Next step is Twitter/X posts. \r\n\r\nDespite following the documented process and adapting various approaches, we encountered multiple challenges, including issues with cookies-based authentication and OAuth2 flow.\r\n\r\nSteps Taken:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication:\r\n\r\nExtracted cookies (auth_token, ct0, guest_id) directly from a valid, logged-in Twitter session.\r\nParsed cookies into the required format and supplied them to the scraper.\r\nEncountered Session is invalid. Login required. after setting the cookies.\r\nRetried using different extracted cookies after logging out and back into the account but received suspicious login alerts from Twitter.\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Authentication (User Context):\r\nConfigured the TWITTER_CLIENT_ID, TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET, and TWITTER_REDIRECT_URL in .env file.\r\n\r\nGenerated the authorization URL and successfully obtained an authorization code after approving the app.\r\n\r\nExchanged the authorization code for an access token. This step initially failed due to redirect URI mismatch but was resolved after fixing .env and redirect configurations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully retrieved an access token but encountered a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to post a tweet using the provided access token.\r\n\r\nOther Efforts:\r\nTested multiple approaches to ensure the server was running properly (ngrok tunnel, express server for callback handling).\r\n\r\nUsed the provided Eliza example retry mechanisms, cookies validation steps, and OAuth2 flows, but no approach successfully enabled the bot to interact with Twitter.\r\n\r\nTechnical Environment:\r\n\r\nEliza Package Version: 0.1.4-alpha.3\r\nNode.js Version: v23.0.0\r\nTwitter API Version: v2\r\nPlan: Free tier with 100 monthly interactions allowed.\r\nErrors Encountered:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication Error: Session is invalid. Login required.\r\nOAuth2 Access Token Exchange Error: \"Value passed for the redirect uri did not match the uri of the authorization code.\"\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Error:\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\",\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"detail\": \"Forbidden\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat We\u2019ve Tried:\r\n\r\nFollowed the Eliza documentation for both cookies-based login and OAuth2 authentication.\r\nValidated cookies format, paths, and domains. Adjusted callback URLs to match the redirect URI.\r\nEnsured correct scopes (tweet.read, tweet.write, offline.access) were included in the authorization URL. Searched for solutions in related GitHub issues and documentation but could not resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nCookies-based login: Is there an additional step needed to validate or reuse cookies without triggering suspicious login alerts?\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Forbidden: Are there any known limitations or configurations for the free tier that could block posting tweets, even after successfully obtaining an access token?\r\n\r\nDocumentation Alignment: Are there updated instructions or examples specific to the latest Twitter API v2 and free-tier limitations that might clarify the proper setup?\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to enable the Eliza bot to post tweets under the speedcto account using either method (cookies or OAuth2).\r\n\r\nThe free-tier plan should suffice for our initial testing (17 tweets/day, 100 interactions/month).\r\nAny guidance or updates on how to resolve these issues would be highly appreciated!",

Based on the amount of chats made with my AI Agent the agents wallet or I as the creator will earn token rewards sent by Avatar.One.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nI am the founder of Avatar.One a 3D AI Chatbot app combining animated VRM avatars with NSFW chat. In our app we have our own avatar maker which allows for over 100k combinations - we can also import custom VRMs. Our app is built on Three.js and loads on mobile and desktop. The companions on Avatar.One come with unique emotes, roleplay features including Netflix and chill, Cyberpunk, Anime Adventure and more. The characters can make selfies, have extensive memory, have custom emotes including striptease and twerk, 1000's of different clothing, the ability for them to go fully naked and of course NSFW chat is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute a plugin to AI16Z which allows Eliza Agents to have their own Avatar.One character profile. They will have their own \"OnlyFans\" profile page which will include bio, profile image, links etc. \r\n\r\nWe will reward the AI Agents or the creators wallet with tokens based on the amount of chats made with the AI Agent. This will drive an income for the AI Agents. It will of course please some of their fans to have NSFW chat. \r\n\r\nAll of our chats are SSH encrypted and stored only on private databases. All users have the ability to delete their history immediately.\r\n\r\nThe full character profile can be added to Avatar.One and their chat will replicate their characters shared on other channel such as Discord.\r\n\r\nAs many AI Agents do not have their own VRMs we can use a vanilla avatar from our maker with the AI Agents profile image applied on the clothing or background of the virtual room. Open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e18749-6213-48a3-8e36-c535cbe79f40)",

Does converting to this standard protocol enhance that at all? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBased on the extensive MCP documentation provided, here are some hypothetical benefits of integrating MCP into this codebase:\r\n\r\n1. **Standardized AI-System Communication**\r\n    - The codebase could leverage MCP's standardized protocol for communication between the AI (Claude) and various system resources\r\n    - This would provide a more structured and secure way to handle interactions compared to custom implementations\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**\r\n    - MCP's resource system could help manage character files and data in a standardized way\r\n    - Characters could be exposed as MCP resources with proper MIME types and metadata\r\n    - Real-time updates to character data could leverage MCP's resource subscription system\r\n\r\n3. **Tool Integration**\r\n    - MCP tools could provide standardized ways to:\r\n      - Read/write character files\r\n      - Validate character data\r\n      - Perform character-related operations\r\n      - Handle file system operations securely\r\n    - Tools could be exposed with clear schemas and descriptions for the AI to understand\r\n\r\n4. **Security Benefits**\r\n    - MCP's security model would provide better isolation and control over what the AI can access\r\n    - Built-in validation and sanitization of inputs\r\n    - Controlled access to file system and other resources\r\n    - Clear error handling patterns\r\n\r\n5. **Development Benefits**\r\n    - Better debugging capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Standardized logging and error reporting\r\n    - Clear separation between AI capabilities and system operations\r\n    - Type safety through SDK integrations\r\n    - Built-in progress reporting for long operations\r\n\r\n6. **Extensibility**\r\n    - Easy addition of new capabilities through MCP servers\r\n    - Potential to integrate with other tools and services\r\n    - Standardized way to add new features that interact with the AI\r\n\r\n7. **Testing & Maintenance**\r\n    - Better testing capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Clear protocol specifications make maintenance easier\r\n    - Standard patterns for error handling and logging\r\n    - Built-in tools for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\nThis would represent a shift from custom implementations to a standardized protocol, potentially making the codebase more maintainable and extensible while improving security and reliability.\r\n"

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now actions are mostly seen as \"side effect\"  happening next to an answer sent by the agent.\r\nThere is no automated way to get the agent to call an action, interpret the result, and answer with that interpretation (which is what I would expect coming from OpenAI actions that are APIs that their runtime call and then get the result interpreted by the agent)\r\n\r\nRight now if I ask my agent: `what actions can you perform right now in the game?`\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\"] \r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThere are two things that could be done. \r\nThe simple one would just have the action result override the answer from the agent (so in the previous example, the first text `I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?` wouldn't even be sent to the client).\r\n\r\nThe complicated one, would have do a second back-and forth with the agent, after getting the action result, in order to interpret that result.\r\n\r\nA) simple:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\", type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, simply adding a \"type\" (or any other field name) with value `OVERRIDE_ANSWER` to the action result, would tell the system to not send the agent answer, only the action result, to the client\r\n\r\nB) complicated:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ data: ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack'], type: \"ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION\" }`\r\n3 - Agent request: `{ prompt: \"You were just asked 'what actions can you perform right now in the game?' which triggered the action 'LIST_GAME_ACTIONS' and the result was ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack']. Can you compose an answer knowing the question and the result?\" }`\r\n4- Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"}`\r\n5 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, there is a second message sent to the agent, telling it \"this is what happened, this is the result, can you interpret it?\". This would be done again through some \"type\"  (`ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION`) on the action result, which would be some kind of \"operation\" to be done by the runtime.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nRight now as an alternative, I go with the \"simple\" solution, and at the client level, if there is any message with a `type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\"` I remove all other messages from the returned messages.\r\n\r\nBut this forces me to do a fork of all the clients to add that filter, when it could be done earlier in the runtime / pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm comparing \"actions\" to OpenAI actions where the agent detects that an action is possible from the prompt and a list of actions that are submitted (it also detects parameters)\r\nThen the agent call the API with those parameters\r\nThe API answers, and the agent interpret the result, create a constructed answer, and returns that answer.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to have a similar behavior for actions here\r\n",
