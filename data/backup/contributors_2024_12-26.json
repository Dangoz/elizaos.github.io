New environment variable pattern: `CHARACTER.YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME.SETTING_NAME`\r\n2. Automatic handling of spaces in character names (converted to underscores)\r\n3. Enhanced settings hierarchy:\r\n   - Character-specific namespaced env variables (highest priority)\r\n   - Character settings from JSON\r\n   - Global environment variables\r\n   - Default values\r\n4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing settings system\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Modified settings loader in `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n- Updated character loading in `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n- Added automatic conversion of character name spaces to underscores\r\n\r\n### Documentation Updates\r\nUpdated documentation to reflect the new feature:\r\n1. Added namespaced settings pattern to secrets management guide\r\n2. Updated configuration guide with new examples\r\n3. Updated agent package documentation with hierarchy explanation\r\n4. Added clear examples for both .env and character.json methods\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes - Documentation has been updated to reflect the new feature:\r\n- Added namespaced settings pattern\r\n- Updated configuration examples\r\n- Updated settings hierarchy explanation\r\n- Added character name handling instructions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n### Feature Testing\r\n1. Review code changes:\r\n   - `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n   - `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Test functionality:\r\n   ```env\r\n   # Test with simple name\r\n   CHARACTER.TESTBOT.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test\r\n   \r\n   # Test with spaces in name\r\n   CHARACTER.MY_TEST_BOT.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-other\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Documentation Testing\r\nReview updated docs:\r\n- docs/docs/guides/secrets-management.md\r\n- docs/docs/guides/configuration.md\r\n- docs/docs/packages/agent.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Feature Testing:\r\n   - Create character with spaces in name\r\n   - Add namespaced variables to .env\r\n   - Verify correct loading into character settings\r\n   - Test precedence over character.json settings\r\n   - Verify backward compatibility\r\n   - Test global fallback behavior\r\n\r\n2. Documentation Verification:\r\n   - Verify pattern examples are correct\r\n   - Verify hierarchy explanation is clear\r\n   - Verify character name handling is explained\r\n   - Test example configurations\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\nN/A - Feature implementation and documentation changes\r\n",

Client App:\r\n- Added image display support in the chat interface\r\n- Implemented image upload functionality\r\n- Enhanced UI to handle image messages\r\n\r\n2. Client Direct:\r\n- Implemented image attachment handling in the `/:agentId/message` POST endpoint.\r\n- Added static file hosting for the direct client so that generated images and uploaded images can be displayed in the client.\r\n\r\n3. Plugin Node:\r\n- Added a `describeImage` Action in the plugin to take advantage of the `ImageDescriptionService` in the same plugin.\r\n- Modified `recognizeWithOpenAI` and `requestOpenAI` to accept local files, similar to how the first frame of .gif files is converted to a buffer and sent over the API\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. `packages/plugin-node/src/services/image.ts` - Core image processing service\r\n2. Client app image upload functionality\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Test image upload:\r\n   - Upload various image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)\r\n   - Verify proper display in chat\r\n   - Confirm image descriptions are generated using built in `describeImage` action\r\n\r\n2.

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) logging and enables the Eliza application to run within Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions).\r\n\r\nAs Eliza is a fully autonomous AI agent capable of running within a TEE, we need to demonstrate to the outside world that we are indeed operating within a TEE. This allows external parties to verify that our actions are protected by the TEE and that they are entirely executed by Eliza, without any third-party interference. Therefore, it is necessary to leverage TEE's remote attestation and establish a TEE logging mechanism to prove that these operations are entirely and autonomously performed by Eliza within the TEE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the existing plugin-tee only supports running Eliza in dstack TDX CVM. However, although TDX is more convenient to use, Intel SGX remains a highly popular TEE in production environments. With the help of Gramine LibOS, it is possible to support running Eliza in SGX, thereby enabling the deployment of Eliza in a broader range of TEE scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n1. Support running Eliza in SGX\r\n2. Add plugin-sgx to support SGX attestation \r\n3. Add plugin-tee-log to support TEE logging (Gramine SGX and Dstack TDX)\r\n4. Add REST API in client-direct to support retrieve TEE logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n## TEE Logging Mechanism:\r\n\r\n1. For each agent, generate a key pair during startup and create a remote attestation for the public key. The private key is securely stored only in the TEE's encrypted memory. The agent's relevant information, along with the public key and attestation, is recorded in a local database. Each time the agent is updated or restarted, a new key pair is regenerated to ensure the security of the keys.\r\n2. For each log, record basic information such as agentId, roomId, userId, type, content, and timestamp. Concatenate all this information and sign it using the agent's corresponding private key to ensure that each log is verifiable. The verification chain/trust chain is as follows: verify the attestation -> trust the public key contained in the attestation -> use the public key to verify the signature -> trust the complete log record.\r\n3. All log data stored locally must be saved in the TEE's encrypted file system in production environments. It must not be stored in plaintext to prevent tampering.\r\n5. Third parties can extract TEE logs for verification. Two types of information can be extracted: \r\n    - Agent information: Extract the agent's metadata, public key, and attestation. The attestation can be used to verify the agent's public key.\r\n    - Log information: Extract the required logs. The agent's attestation and public key can be used to verify the signature, ensuring that each record has not been tampered with.\r\n6. We also provide integrity protection when extracting TEE logs. When users extract TEE logs via the REST API, we hash the results and generate an attestation. After extracting the information, users can verify the attestation to compare the hash value contained within it with the results, thereby ensuring the integrity of the results.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to add new documentation about TEE logging and how to run Eliza in SGX\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. plugin-sgx\r\n2. plugin-tee-log\r\n3. other parts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Test SGX support\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to prepare the SGX environment and install the Gramine dependencies according to https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\r\n\r\nThen, start eliza in SGX:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npnpm i\r\npnpm build\r\n\r\n# Start default character\r\nSGX=1 make start\r\n# Start specific character\r\nSGX=1 make start -- --character \"character/trump.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test TEE logging\r\n\r\nTo get started, prepare the TEE environment. Both dstack TDX and Gramine SGX are supported.\r\n\r\nNext, enable TEE logging by configuring the .env file:\r\n```\r\nENABLE_TEE_LOG=true \r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, integrate the TeeLogService into specific actions as needed. For example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { ServiceType, ITeeLogService } from \"@elizaos/core\";\r\n\r\n        const teeLogService = runtime\r\n            .getService<ITeeLogService>(ServiceType.TEE_LOG)\r\n            .getInstance();\r\n        if (teeLogService.log(\r\n                runtime.agentId,\r\n                message.roomId,\r\n                message.userId,\r\n                \"Action:CONTINUE\",\r\n                \"Continue\"\r\n            )\r\n        ) {\r\n            console.log(\"Logged tee log\");\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n- The StakeProtocolProvider uses the [Solana LST data provider](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lst-data-provider) open-sourced by stafiprotocol to provide data support. You can choose to use the default Stafi API or deploy it yourself.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: \u201cMy address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL\u201d.\r\n3.
