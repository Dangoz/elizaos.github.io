Creates a new `i18n/readme/` directory structure for README translations\n2. Updates the main README.md translation links to point to the new directory\n3. Updates the GitHub workflow to output translations to the new directory\n4. Improves project root directory organization\n\n## What kind of change is this?\nImprovements (reorganization of existing documentation structure)\n\n# Documentation changes needed?\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\n- Updated all translation links in main README.md\n- Updated GitHub workflow configuration for translation generation\n- Created new directory structure for translations\n\n# Testing\n\n## Where should a reviewer start?\n1. Check the updated README.md translation links\n2. Verify the GitHub workflow configuration changes\n3. Ensure translations are being generated in the correct directory\n\n## Detailed testing steps\n1. Run the README translation workflow\n2. Verify translations are generated in `i18n/readme/` directory\n3. Verify all links in main README.md work correctly\n4. Check that the commit action still works with the new file paths\n\n# Deploy Notes\nAfter merging:\n1. The next translation workflow run will create the `i18n/readme` directory if it doesn't exist\n2. All new translations will be generated in the new directory structure",

            "body": "# Relates to\r\nEliza AI agents, blockchain data analytics, Chainbase\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow. This is a new feature that adds functionality without disrupting existing systems.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR do? \r\nThis PR introduces a new Chainbase plugin for Eliza that enables AI agents to access and analyze blockchain data across multiple networks using natural language queries. The plugin leverages Chainbase's comprehensive data infrastructure to provide real-time insights.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nEliza AI agents currently lack the ability to easily access and analyze on-chain data, especially across multiple blockchain networks. This plugin bridges that gap by allowing users to query blockchain data using natural language without requiring deep technical blockchain knowledge. It unlocks powerful new analytics and insight generation capabilities for Eliza.\r\n\r\nThis work builds upon Chainbase's existing multi-chain data infrastructure and Eliza's natural language processing capabilities. It is part of the broader initiative to make blockchain data more accessible and actionable for end users.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nI have updated the documentation to include:\r\n- Overview of the Chainbase plugin and its purpose\r\n- Installation and configuration instructions \r\n- Examples of natural language queries and the blockchain insights generated\r\n- API reference for key functions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the updated documentation to understand the purpose and functionality of the plugin\r\n2. Run the automated test suite: `npm run test`\r\n3. Follow the instructions to install and configure the plugin in a dev environment\r\n4. Test sample natural language queries against blockchain data and verify the insights generated match expected results\r\n5. Review the code changes, focusing on the integration between Eliza's NLP and Chainbase's data layer\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install and configure the Chainbase plugin by following the documentation \r\n2. From the Eliza interface, input a natural language query such as \"What is the total transaction volume on Ethereum in the last 24 hours?\" \r\n3. Verify the plugin converts this to the appropriate Chainbase query and returns the expected analytics\r\n4. Test queries across multiple supported blockchain networks \r\n5. Verify error handling for unsupported networks or malformed queries\r\n6. Run edge case tests from the automated test suite and ensure code coverage meets standards\r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions\r\n1. Merge PR after review and testing approval\r\n2. Update Eliza production environment to point to the new Chainbase plugin version\r\n3. Restart Eliza web servers\r\n4. Smoke test Chainbase queries from the production Eliza interface \r\n5. Monitor error logs and system metrics post-deployment to ensure stability\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any other information to include in the PR description! I aimed to be thorough while following the provided template.\r\n\r\n# Screenshot\r\n<img width=\"979\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53778fc-45a1-43b1-9417-2d4dc622b6ed\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1205\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/869d781e-96d4-459e-82c1-a16f18e1c2b1\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n",

List what kind of risks and what could be affected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an inheritance system for character files, allowing for more organized and maintainable character configurations. \r\n\r\n### Key Features:\r\n\r\n1. **Inheritance Mechanism**:\r\n    - Character files can now include an `extends` field, which is an array of parent character files.\r\n    - Example:\r\n      ```json\r\n      {\r\n        \"extends\": [\"parent1.character.json\", \"parent2.character.json\"]\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n    - When a child character file is loaded, it first loads all information from its specified parent character files.\r\n\r\n2. **Improved Organization**:\r\n    - This system allows for better organization of character files by enabling shared configurations across multiple characters.\r\n    - Common traits and settings can be defined in parent files, reducing redundancy and making updates easier.\r\n\r\n3. **Ease of Maintenance**:\r\n    - Updates to parent character files automatically propagate to all child character files, ensuring consistency and reducing the need for manual updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\n- **Modularity**: Break down character configurations into reusable components.\r\n- **Scalability**: Easily manage and scale character configurations as the project grows.\r\n- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent settings and traits across multiple characters with minimal effort.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly enhances the flexibility and maintainability of character files, making it easier to manage complex configurations and updates.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n1. **Define Parent Character Files**:\r\n    - Create character files with common settings and traits that you want to share across multiple characters.\r\n    - Example `parent1.character.json`:\r\n      ```json\r\n      {\r\n        \"name\": \"Parent Character 1\",\r\n        \"bio\": \"This is a parent character.\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n          \"voice\": { \"model\": \"en_US-male-medium\" }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n2. **Create Child Character Files**:\r\n    - In the child character files, use the `extends` field to specify the parent character files.\r\n    - Example `child.character.json`:\r\n      ```json\r\n      {\r\n        \"extends\": [\"parent1.character.json\"],\r\n        \"name\": \"Child Character\",\r\n        \"bio\": \"This is a child character inheriting from Parent Character 1.\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n3. **Run the Project**:\r\n    - Use the command `pnpm start --character=\"child.character.json\"` to load the character files. The system will automatically handle the inheritance and load the necessary information from the parent files.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe [`plugin-node`](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/plugin-node) gives you an S3-compatible API. However, it assumes you're _using_ AWS S3; it doesn't let you use S3-compatible tooling because the request URL is not configurable. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe should allow the plugin to take an additional (optional) env var called `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`, which if set, will use the URL for bucket operations. The `plugin-node` only needs a small change [here](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/ea9d1c02291dea26b25c815be30db5c91e6ceb21/packages/plugin-node/src/services/awsS3.ts#L60) to handle the URL. If it's set, use it; else, use AWS\u2014and this ensures the setup is backward compatible:\r\n```ts\r\nconst clientConfig: S3ClientConfig = {\r\n    region: AWS_REGION,\r\n    credentials: {\r\n        accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,\r\n        secretAccessKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,\r\n    },\r\n};\r\nif (AWS_S3_ENDPOINT) {\r\n    clientConfig.endpoint = AWS_S3_ENDPOINT;\r\n    clientConfig.forcePathStyle = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis.s3Client = new S3Client(clientConfig);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIf you're using non-AWS tooling that has an S3-compatible API, you **must** have the ability to customize this URL. There's no alternative. Without this feature, you'll get an error like this when, e.g., calling `uploadFile` against a local S3 service:\r\n```\r\nThe AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nYou can test this pattern against [something like MinIO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html). Run a local MinIO server, set the env var `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` in your Eliza setup, and then upload a file. \r\n\r\nOutside of the scope of this issue, it'd be nice if the S3 plugin had additional features for the following. These would be useful for additional agent memory or storage options.\r\n- Creating buckets\r\n- Listing buckets\r\n- Querying buckets\r\n- Getting / downloading objects\r\n\r\nIf these additional features are desirable, I can open a separate issue for adding new `plugin-node` S3 methods.",

Install the image generation plugin\r\n2. Start the agent with the plugin enabled\r\n\r\n## Error Message\r\nTypeError: The database connection is not open\r\nat Database.prepare (/Users/xxx/eliza/node_modules/better-sqlite3/lib/methods/wrappers.js:5:21)\r\nat SqliteDatabaseAdapter.getParticipantsForAccount (file:///Users/xxx/eliza/packages/adapter-sqlite/dist/index.js:137:30)\r\nat AgentRuntime.ensureParticipantExists (file:///Users/xxx/eliza/packages/core/dist/index.js:29863:57)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Stack Trace Analysis\r\nThe error occurs in:\r\n1. `packages/adapter-sqlite/dist/index.js:137:30`\r\n2. `packages/core/dist/index.js:29863:57`\r\n3. Specifically in `AgentRuntime.ensureParticipantExists`\r\n\r\n## Additional Context\r\n- The application works fine without the image generation plugin\r\n- The error seems to be triggered by the core's participant management system, not directly by the plugin\r\n- No database configuration is required in the documentation for the image plugin\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Node.js: v23.5.0\r\n- Package Manager: pnpm",
