Perhaps we could enhance this PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1220 by including functionality to quote the user\u2019s message for image replies. However, it seems this PR primarily focuses on improving the image generation plugin prompt. It might be a good idea to adjust the title to better reflect the scope of the changes."

This command installs dependencies recursively across all workspaces and refreshes the lockfile to reflect any changes in dependencies.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Updates:** This is a non-breaking change that updates the lockfile to ensure it accurately represents the current state of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nUpdating the lockfile ensures that all dependencies are correctly resolved and that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments.

Please describe.**\n\nThe current logging mechanism does not capture detailed error information when API calls fail, making it difficult to diagnose issues and improve the user experience.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement an enhanced logging system that captures detailed error messages, including the API endpoint, request parameters, and response status codes. This can be achieved by integrating a structured logging library such as Winston or Bunyan.\n\n**Code Example**\n\n```javascript\nconst logger = require('winston');\n\nasync function makeApiCall(endpoint, params) {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch(endpoint, { method: 'GET', body: JSON.stringify(params) });\n        if (!response.ok) {\n            throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.status} - ${response.statusText}`);\n        }\n        return await response.json();\n    } catch (error) {\n        logger.error('API call failed', { endpoint, params, error: error.message });\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nUsing the current logging mechanism, which only captures the error message without context.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEnhanced logging will provide better visibility into API failures, allowing for quicker diagnosis and resolution of issues, which will ultimately improve the user experience.",

                "body": "Some tips about this \r\n\r\n### Comprehensive Solution for Uniform Application of `trimTokens`\r\n\r\n#### 1. **TLDR (Executive Summary)**\r\n   - **Issue Essence**: Inconsistent application of `trimTokens` across LLM calls leads to context window errors.\r\n   - **Root Cause**: `trimTokens` is not uniformly applied in all LLM calls.\r\n   - **Solution Approach**: Ensure `trimTokens` is applied consistently across all LLM calls.\r\n   - **Impact Assessment**: Prevents context window errors, improves code consistency, and enhances performance.\r\n\r\n#### 2. **Quick Resolution Path**\r\n   - **Immediate Steps**:\r\n     1. Locate the `trimTokens` function in `packages/core/src/generation.ts`.\r\n     2. Identify all LLM calls in the codebase.\r\n     3. Apply `trimTokens` uniformly in each LLM call.\r\n   - **Exact File Locations and Line Numbers**:\r\n     - `packages/core/src/generation.ts` (Line 308)\r\n   - **Required Code Changes**:\r\n     ```typescript\r\n     // Example LLM call without trimTokens\r\n     const response = llmCall(input);\r\n\r\n     // Modified LLM call with trimTokens\r\n     const trimmedInput = trimTokens(input);\r\n     const response = llmCall(trimmedInput);\r\n     ```\r\n   - **Validation Commands**:\r\n     - Run unit tests to ensure no context window errors occur.\r\n     - Test each function that makes LLM calls.\r\n   - **Rollback Procedures**:\r\n     - Revert the changes if errors are introduced.\r\n     - Use version control to track changes.\r\n\r\n#### 3. **Comprehensive Solution**\r\n   - **Detailed Technical Analysis**:\r\n     - The `trimTokens` function truncates the context to the maximum length allowed by the model. Inconsistent application leads to errors when the context window is exceeded.\r\n   - **Step-by-Step Implementation**:\r\n     1. Review `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to locate `trimTokens`.\r\n     2. Identify all functions that make LLM calls.\r\n     3. Apply `trimTokens` before each LLM call.\r\n     4. Test the application to ensure no context window errors occur.\r\n   - **Dependencies and Side Effects**:\r\n     - No additional dependencies required.\r\n     - Ensure `trimTokens` does not truncate important data.\r\n   - **Configuration Changes**:\r\n     - No configuration changes needed.\r\n   - **Environment Requirements**:\r\n     - Ensure the environment supports the updated code.\r\n   - **Database Changes**:\r\n     - No database changes required.\r\n   - **Service Impacts**:\r\n     - Improved stability and performance of LLM calls."

The key focus areas include centralizing dependency management, refactoring database adapters, enhancing testing coverage, improving error handling, and optimizing performance.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Implementation Plan\r\n\r\n### 1. Centralize Dependency Management\r\n- **Objective**: Move shared dependencies to the root `package.json` to avoid version mismatches and streamline updates.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Identify all shared dependencies across the project.\r\n  2. Move these dependencies to the root `package.json`.\r\n  3. Remove duplicate dependencies from individual package `package.json` files.\r\n  4. Update import statements in affected files to reference the centralized dependencies.\r\n\r\n### 2. Refactor Database Adapters\r\n- **Objective**: Ensure all adapters follow a consistent pattern for dependency management and error handling.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Review and standardize the dependency management approach across all database adapters.\r\n  2. Implement consistent error handling patterns using `try-catch` blocks and `elizaLogger`.\r\n  3. Update database interaction methods (`createAccount`, `getAccountById`, `createMemory`, `removeMemory`) to use centralized dependencies.\r\n\r\n### 3. Enhance Testing Coverage\r\n- **Objective**: Increase unit test coverage for all critical methods, especially those interacting with external services.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Identify methods with insufficient test coverage.\r\n  2. Write additional unit tests for these methods.\r\n  3. Ensure tests cover edge cases and error scenarios.\r\n\r\n### 4. Improve Error Handling\r\n- **Objective**: Implement more robust error handling strategies to cover edge cases and provide clearer feedback in logs.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Review existing error handling mechanisms.\r\n  2. Enhance error handling to cover additional edge cases.\r\n  3. Improve error messages and logging for better traceability.\r\n\r\n### 5. Optimize Performance\r\n- **Objective**: Review database interaction patterns to identify and mitigate potential performance bottlenecks.\r\n- **Steps**:\r\n  1. Analyze current database interaction patterns.\r\n  2. Identify and address potential performance bottlenecks.\r\n  3. Optimize synchronous database calls, especially for large datasets.\r\n\r\n## Technical Specifications\r\n\r\n### Data Structures\r\n- **Dependency List**: A centralized list of shared dependencies in the root `package.json`.\r\n- **Error Logs**: Enhanced error logs using `elizaLogger` for better traceability.\r\n\r\n### API Contracts\r\n- **Database Adapters**: Standardized methods for database interactions (`createAccount`, `getAccountById`, `createMemory`, `removeMemory`).\r\n\r\n### State Management\r\n- **Centralized Dependencies**: Shared dependencies managed in the root `package.json`.\r\n\r\n### Error Handling\r\n- **Consistent Patterns**: Use of `try-catch` blocks and `elizaLogger` across all adapters and clients.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Identify Shared Dependencies**:\r\n   - Analyze all `package.json` files to identify shared dependencies.\r\n   - Create a list of dependencies to be centralized.\r\n\r\n2. **Move Dependencies to Root `package.json`**:\r\n   - Update the root `package.json` with the identified shared dependencies.\r\n   -

Current Implementation Analysis\r\n- **Exact files and classes involved**:\r\n  - **PostgresDatabaseAdapter** (packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **RedisClient** (packages/adapter-redis/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **SqliteDatabaseAdapter** (packages/adapter-sqlite/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **SqlJsDatabaseAdapter** (packages/adapter-sqljs/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **SupabaseDatabaseAdapter** (packages/adapter-supabase/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **DirectClient** (packages/client-direct/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **DiscordClient** (packages/client-discord/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **GitHubClient** (packages/client-github/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **LensAgentClient** (packages/client-lens/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **SlackClient** (packages/client-slack/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **TelegramClient** (packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts)\r\n  - **TwitterManager** (packages/client-twitter/src/index.ts)\r\n\r\n- **Current error handling patterns**:\r\n  - Use of `try-catch` blocks to handle errors during database operations and API calls.\r\n  - Logging errors with `elizaLogger` for better traceability.\r\n  - Specific error messages are thrown when operations fail, allowing for easier debugging.\r\n\r\n- **Existing test coverage**:\r\n  - Tests are present for various components, particularly in the `core` directory (e.g., tests for actions, database interactions).\r\n  - Each adapter has methods that can be unit tested, ensuring that database interactions are functioning as expected.\r\n\r\n- **Known issues or pain points**:\r\n  - Potential for version mismatches in dependencies across various adapters and clients.\r\n  - Error handling may not cover all edge cases, particularly in asynchronous operations.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Key Components\r\n- **Specific functions/methods to modify**:\r\n  - `createAccount`, `getAccountById`, `createMemory`, and `removeMemory` methods across different database adapters should be reviewed for dependency management.\r\n  \r\n- **Database interaction patterns**:\r\n  - Each adapter implements a specific database interaction pattern, e.g., using `pg` for PostgreSQL, `better-sqlite3` for SQLite, and `ioredis` for Redis.\r\n  \r\n- **Error handling mechanisms**:\r\n  - Centralized error logging using `elizaLogger` across all adapters and clients.\r\n  \r\n- **Test file locations and coverage**:\r\n  - Tests are located in the `tests` directory within the `core` package and other respective adapter directories.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Technical Debt Assessment\r\n- **Current architectural limitations**:\r\n  - Each database adapter operates independently, which may lead to inconsistencies in how dependencies are managed across the application.\r\n  \r\n- **Error handling gaps**:\r\n  - Some methods may not handle specific database errors effectively, particularly in edge cases.\r\n  \r\n- **Testing gaps**:\r\n  - Not all methods are covered by unit tests, particularly those involving complex interactions or external API calls.\r\n  \r\n- **Performance bottlenecks**:\r\n  - Potential performance issues with synchronous database calls, especially when handling large datasets.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Initial Architecture Review\r\n- **Current design patterns used**:\r\n  - Adapter pattern for database interactions.\r\n  - Use of Promises and async/await for managing asynchronous operations.\r\n  \r\n- **Dependency management**:\r\n  - Dependencies are managed within each adapter, but there is a need for a centralized approach to avoid duplication.\r\n  \r\n- **State handling**:\r\n  - State is managed within individual clients and adapters, which may lead to inconsistencies.\r\n  \r\n- **Resource management**:\r\n  - Each adapter manages its own resources (e.g., database connections), but there is no overarching resource management strategy.\r\n\r\n### Recommendations for Dependency Deduplication Process\r\n1. **Centralize Dependency Management**: Move shared dependencies to the root `package.json` to avoid version mismatches and streamline updates.\r\n2. **Refactor Database Adapters**: Ensure that all adapters follow a consistent pattern for dependency management and error handling.\r\n3. **Enhance Testing Coverage**: Increase unit test coverage for all critical methods, especially those interacting with external services.\r\n4. **Improve Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling strategies to cover edge cases and provide clearer feedback in logs.\r\n5. **Optimize Performance**: Review database interaction patterns to identify and mitigate potential performance bottlenecks, particularly in high-load scenarios.\r\n\r\nBy addressing these areas, the implementation of a dependency deduplication process can be effectively achieved, leading to a more maintainable and efficient codebase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### LLD_agent Deep Dive Analysis\r\n\r\n### Implementation Analysis of Dependency Deduplication Process\r\n\r\n#### 1.

This limitation may hinder the integration of diverse models that could enhance performance and scalability.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nImplement a flexible token trimming mechanism that supports a variety of models beyond TiktokenModel. This could involve abstracting the token trimming logic to accommodate different model architectures and tokenization strategies.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nContinuing with the current model-specific approach, but this would limit the flexibility and potential for optimization across different models.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nExpanding support for non-OpenAI models will improve the system's adaptability and allow for better optimization of token trimming processes.

New `validateVectorSetup` function:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   private async validateVectorSetup(): Promise<boolean> {\r\n       try {\r\n           const vectorExt = await this.query(`\r\n               SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n           `);\r\n           const hasVector = vectorExt.rows.length > 0;\r\n           \r\n           if (!hasVector) {\r\n               elizaLogger.error(\"Vector extension not found in database\");\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n           \r\n           return true;\r\n       } catch (error) {\r\n           elizaLogger.error(\"Failed to validate vector extension:\", {\r\n               error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)\r\n           });\r\n           return false;\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Enhanced `init()` method:\r\n   - Added vector validation during initialization\r\n   - Improved schema application logic\r\n   - Better error handling for vector operations\r\n   - Proper dimension validation (1536)\r\n\r\n## Testing Infrastructure\r\n\r\n### New Test Suite\r\nLocated in `src/__tests__/`:\r\n\r\n1. `vector-extension.test.ts`:\r\n   - Schema management tests\r\n   - Memory operations with vector tests\r\n   - Error handling and validation tests\r\n\r\n2. `docker-compose.test.yml`:\r\n   ```yaml\r\n   version: '3.8'\r\n   services:\r\n     postgres-test:\r\n       image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16\r\n       environment:\r\n         POSTGRES_DB: eliza_test\r\n         POSTGRES_USER: postgres\r\n         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres\r\n       ports:\r\n         - \"5433:5432\"\r\n       healthcheck:\r\n         test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready\"]\r\n         interval: 10s\r\n         timeout: 5s\r\n         retries: 5\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. `run_tests.sh` - Automated test environment\r\n4. `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation\r\n\r\n## Test Results\r\n\r\n### Vector Extension Tests\r\n```\r\n\u2713 Schema and Extension Management (4/4)\r\n  \u2713 should initialize with vector extension\r\n  \u2713 should handle missing rooms table\r\n  \u2713 should not reapply schema when everything exists\r\n  \u2713 should handle transaction rollback on error\r\n\r\n\u2713 Memory Operations with Vector (3/3)\r\n  \u2713 should create and retrieve memory with vector embedding\r\n  \u2713 should search memories by embedding\r\n  \u2713 should handle invalid embedding dimensions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Environment Details\r\n- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector\r\n- Test database: eliza_test\r\n- Port: 5433 (isolated)\r\n- Vector dimensions: 1536 (OpenAI standard)\r\n\r\n## Key Improvements\r\n\r\n1. **Vector Validation**:\r\n   - Proper dimension verification (1536)\r\n   - Extension presence checks\r\n   - Clear error messages\r\n   - Robust validation logic\r\n\r\n2. **Testing Infrastructure**:\r\n   - Automated test environment\r\n   - Comprehensive test coverage\r\n   - Isolated testing setup\r\n   - Vector-specific test cases\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation**:\r\n   - Setup instructions\r\n   - Testing procedures\r\n   - Troubleshooting guide\r\n   - Vector operation examples\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n- Resolves #1687\r\n- Ensures correct vector dimensions\r\n- Prevents invalid vector operations\r\n- Provides comprehensive testing\r\n- Improves error handling and logging\r\n- Better developer experience with clear error messages\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 16+\r\n- pgvector extension\r\n- Docker for testing\r\n- Node.js and pnpm\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- Implementation validates vector dimensions properly\r\n- All tests passing successfully\r\n- Proper error handling for vector operations\r\n- Comprehensive test coverage for vector functionality\r\n- Clear error messages for debugging\r\n",

            "body": "# PR: Fix PostgreSQL Vector Extension Issues (#1561)\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe PostgreSQL adapter was encountering a \"type vector does not exist\" error when trying to create tables that use the `vector` type. This was happening because:\r\n1. The `vector` extension was being created in the `extensions` schema\r\n2. The `vector` type wasn't accessible in the `public` schema where tables were being created\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nWe implemented a robust fix that:\r\n1. Creates the `extensions` schema if it doesn't exist\r\n2. Properly handles the `vector` extension creation in the `extensions` schema\r\n3. Adds the `extensions` schema to the search path before table creation\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n```sql\r\n-- Create extensions schema first\r\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;\r\n\r\nDO $$\r\nBEGIN\r\n    IF NOT EXISTS (\r\n        SELECT 1\r\n        FROM pg_extension\r\n        WHERE extname = 'vector'\r\n    ) THEN\r\n        CREATE EXTENSION vector\r\n        SCHEMA extensions;\r\n    END IF;\r\nEND $$;\r\n\r\n-- Add extensions schema to search path\r\nSET search_path TO public, extensions;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing and Verification\r\n### Test Environment\r\n- Docker container using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image\r\n- Clean PostgreSQL instance with pgvector support\r\n- Database: `eliza_test`\r\n\r\n### Test Scenarios\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Installation Test**\r\n   - \u2705 Schema creation successful\r\n   - \u2705 Vector extension created without errors\r\n   - \u2705 All tables created with correct vector type\r\n   - \u2705 All indexes created successfully\r\n   - \u2705 Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n2. **Idempotency Test (Second Run)**\r\n   - \u2705 No duplicate key errors\r\n   - \u2705 Proper handling of existing objects with NOTICE messages\r\n   - \u2705 Vector extension checks working correctly\r\n   - \u2705 Transaction committed successfully\r\n\r\n### Test Results\r\n```sql\r\n-- First Run Output\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\nCREATE EXTENSION\r\nSET\r\n[... tables and indexes created successfully ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n\r\n-- Second Run Output\r\nNOTICE: schema \"extensions\" already exists, skipping\r\nCREATE SCHEMA\r\nDO\r\n[... proper \"already exists\" notices ...]\r\nCOMMIT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\nThis fix:\r\n- Resolves issue #1561\r\n- Prevents duplicate extension creation errors\r\n- Maintains proper schema organization\r\n- Ensures vector operations work correctly across schemas\r\n- Provides idempotent schema creation\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- The solution follows PostgreSQL best practices for extension management\r\n- Schema search path is explicitly set to ensure type availability\r\n- Implementation is idempotent and safe to run multiple times\r\n- Tested with pgvector-enabled PostgreSQL instance\r\n- No changes required to application code\r\n\r\n## Required Environment\r\n- PostgreSQL 15 or later\r\n- pgvector extension must be available (e.g., using `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` image)\r\n- Proper permissions to create schemas and extensions\r\n",

The reported issue (#1703) appears to be related to incorrect usage rather than a defect in the logger itself. All test cases demonstrate proper error description display when the logger is used correctly.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nIssue can be closed with:\r\n1. Reference to proper usage patterns\r\n2. Link to new documentation\r\n3. Examples of correct error logging implementation\r\n"

Delete `cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/tokenizer.json`\r\n2. Start an agent using local embeddings\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`pnpm clean` should resolve any cache related issues.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n",

The main risks are:\r\n\r\n- Rate limiting from CoinMarketCap API (Stricter limits compared to CoinGecko)\r\n- Potential timeout issues when the API is slow\r\n- Invalid cryptocurrency symbols causing failed requests\r\n- Cost implications as CoinMarketCap API is a paid service\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Adds a new CoinMarketCap plugin for cryptocurrency price checking\r\n- Implements a `GET_PRICE` action that fetches current prices using the v1 API\r\n- Provides TypeScript types and interfaces for CoinMarketCap API responses\r\n- Includes environment validation for API key configuration\r\n- Adds proper error handling for API calls and symbol validation\r\n\r\n### What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality):\r\n\r\n- New plugin implementation\r\n- New paid API integration\r\n- New TypeScript types and validation\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n\r\n- Add CoinMarketCap plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required API key configuration\r\n- Add usage examples for price checking\r\n- Update plugin list in main documentation\r\n- Add pricing/rate limit considerations\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the plugin implementation in `/plugin-coinmarketcap/src/`\r\n2. Check the main action implementation in `index.ts`\r\n3. Verify API service in `service.ts`\r\n4. Review type definitions in `types.ts`\r\n5. Check template handling in `template.ts`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Set up environment:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run agent locally and test natural language queries:\r\n   - \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\"\r\n   - \"Show me ETH price in USD\"\r\n   - \"Get the price of SOL\"\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n   - Try with invalid symbols\r\n   - Test API timeout scenarios\r\n   - Check rate limit handling\r\n   - Verify currency conversion handling\r\n\r\n## Future Expansion\r\n\r\n### 1. Extended CoinMarketCap Integration\r\n\r\n- Add support for all available cryptocurrencies\r\n- Include market data (market cap, volume, supply)\r\n- Add historical price data\r\n- Support multiple currency conversions\r\n- Implement proper rate limit handling\r\n\r\n### 2. Additional API Features\r\n\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/map` - Add support for symbol/id mapping\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/info` - Include detailed crypto metadata\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/listings/latest` - Add market data sorting and filtering\r\n- `/cryptocurrency/categories` - Support category-based queries\r\n- `/global-metrics/quotes/latest` - Add global market metrics\r\n\r\n### 3.

Adds HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration with BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 as default\r\n2. Integrates Heurist into the embedding provider system with 1024 dimension vectors\r\n3.

Implements remote embedding functionality for the Heurist provider\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - Adds new embedding provider capability\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document the new Heurist embedding provider and its configuration options.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Check the .env.example file for the new HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration\r\n2. Review the embedding.ts changes for proper integration\r\n3. Verify the model configuration updates in the Models section\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL in environment\r\n2. Test embedding generation with the new provider:\r\n   - Verify 1024-dimension vectors are generated correctly\r\n   - Confirm remote embedding functionality works\r\n   - Check fallback to BGE when appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nN/A - No UI changes involved\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nThe following environment variables need to be configured:\r\n- HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\r\n- USE_HEURIST_EMBEDDING=true\r\n- HEURIST_API_KEY (if using remote embeddings)\r\n\r\nand in the `character.json` use the following\r\n```\r\n    \"modelProvider\": \"heurist\",\r\n```",

                "body": "A simple and efficient approach is to use environment variables in the Dockerfile to load `.env` and `characters` configuration files, and then use Kubernetes configuration files to mount different configurations for each Eliza container. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. **Use Environment Variables in the Dockerfile:**  \r\nDefine default environment variables in the Dockerfile using the `ENV` directive to specify the paths for the `.env` and `characters` configuration files.  \r\n```dockerfile\r\n# Set default configuration file paths\r\nENV ENV_FILE_PATH=/app/config/.env\r\nENV CHARACTERS_FILE_PATH=/app/config/characters.json\r\n```  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. **Dynamically Load Configurations in the Application:**  \r\nEnsure that the application can dynamically load the `.env` and `characters` configuration files using the paths specified in the environment variables. This allows the application to adapt to different environments at runtime.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. **Use Different Config in Kubernetes:**  \r\n\r\n**Example Kubernetes Configuration:**  \r\n```yaml\r\n\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Pod\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: eliza-instance1\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n    - name: eliza-container\r\n      image: your-eliza-image\r\n      env:\r\n        - name: ENV_FILE_PATH\r\n          value: \"/config/.env1\"\r\n        - name: CHARACTERS_FILE_PATH\r\n          value: \"/config/charactersXXX.json\"\r\n      volumeMounts:\r\n        - name: config-volume\r\n          mountPath: /config\r\n  volumes:\r\n    - name: config-volume\r\n      configMap:\r\n        name: eliza-config-instance1\r\n```  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. **Load Different Configurations for Different Instances:**  \r\n- Create separate Config for each Eliza instance, with customized content as needed.  \r\n- Reference the corresponding Config in the Kubernetes configuration file to ensure each instance loads the correct configuration.  \r\n\r\n"

The current multi-page approach requires extra navigation steps to switch between agents. This redesign aims to simplify the experience by making it easier to switch between conversations while maintaining context.\r\n\r\n- Removes the multi-page routing structure in favor of a single-page chat interface\r\n- Implements a collapsible sidebar containing agent selection\r\n- Adds a chat-like interface with agent header and message thread\r\n- Integrates theme toggle into the new sidebar\r\n- Adds avatar generation for agents using DiceBear\r\n- Improves overall UI/UX with modern chat application patterns\r\n\r\n## Questions to Consider\r\n1. Is chat the primary interaction mode we want to focus on?\r\n2. Is there a specific planned feature roadmap for `client` app?\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Start with `client/src/Agents.tsx` to review the new main layout structure\r\n2. Review `client/src/Chat.tsx` to see the simplified chat component\r\n3. Check the router changes in `client/src/router.tsx`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Launch the application and verify the new sidebar layout appears\r\n2. Test sidebar collapse/expand functionality\r\n3. Select different agents and verify chat history remains isolated\r\n4. Test theme toggle in the new sidebar location\r\n5. Verify message sending/receiving still works as expected\r\n6. Test responsive design at various screen sizes\r\n7. Verify avatar generation for each agent\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![eliza_chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0035a547-8721-4fee-8b50-b16283c31a0b)\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nStandard deployment - no special steps required.\r\n",

Any context or related work?\r\n- To improve the performance and maintainability of the EVM plugin that we use in production.\r\n- To ensure the transfer action operates in line with its intended functionality, reducing the risk of errors.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review changes in the wallet provider (`WalletProvider`) for caching logic.\r\n2. Examine the updated transfer action implementation to verify type alignment and state updates.\r\n3. Test the improved transfer template to ensure JSON responses are valid and placeholders function correctly.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Run unit tests for the wallet provider to verify caching functionality.\r\n2. Test the transfer action manually by asking an agent for a transfer and checking:\r\n   - Correct state updates.\r\n   - Valid and cached wallet balance in the state.\r\n   - Successful transaction.\r\n3. Verify the cache expiry behavior by observing multiple wallet balance fetches within and outside the 5-second TTL.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo specific deploy instructions needed; automated tests and regular deployment process suffice.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n**nikita_zhou**\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Agent interaction\r\n\r\nLink to the tx: https://testnet.iotexscan.io/tx/f946fce5bc127761bd780444bf2d3180bf66fa4944b37e803767e99e76dd0d13\r\n\r\n<img width=\"755\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 12 25 34\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c765432-ced8-4944-b543-aa6dbc99d2c3\" />\r\n\r\n### Caching\r\n\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 12 26 43\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfc17094-02d0-4b09-ba30-2018501d6277\" />\r\n\r\n### Linting\r\n\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 10 31 25\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb011bf-d84d-4550-99ef-4212b341265b\" />\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1122\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-02 at 10 20 39\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af098dac-2e22-4b0e-b6a1-540d8e8ebe9a\" />\r\n",

Ensure all existing tests for memory fetching pass.\r\n2. Manually test the memory-fetching feature by:\r\n   - Querying with and without the `limit` parameter.\r\n   - Verifying that the sorting order (`createdAt DESC`) is maintained.\r\n3.

            "body": "Co-authored @Hmac512  @RonTuretzky @Gajesh2007 \r\n## Background\r\nA few weeks ago, issues with aixbt were observed, where users mistakenly believed the moderation was performed by humans. This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs and MPC for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a high-level diagram of the process. \r\n\r\n```mermaid \r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n    autonumber\r\n    participant Eliza\r\n    participant Cloudflare\r\n    participant OpenAI\r\n    Eliza ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Req\r\n    Cloudflare ->> OpenAI : Prompt Req\r\n    OpenAI ->> Cloudflare : Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Cloudflare : Log Prompt Response\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Eliza : Prompt Response\r\n    create participant Opacity\r\n    Eliza ->> Opacity : Generate Proof for Prompt Response\r\n    Opacity ->> Cloudflare : Fetch Prompt Response Log in MPC-TLS\r\n    Cloudflare ->> Opacity : Respond with Prompt Response Log\r\n    Opacity ->> Eliza : Return Proof of Prompt Response Log\r\n```\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR integrates Opacity as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Opacity is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nIntroducing a new adaptor to produce verifiable inference. \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating Opacity as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zk/MPC proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's/Opacity's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging Actively Validated Services (AVS) to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n[Cloudflare's AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) provides logs for all prompt request responses , which are the target of the mpc-tls , ensuring that all AVS validators are performing MPC-TLS on the same date. \r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-opacity `README.md` and `.example.env`\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n## Proof Verification Example\r\n\r\n[Here](https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/logs/01JGD81FDMV4ZHB625BGGKVDSC) is proof of a prompt request. This can be verified using the adapter or otherwise through `https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify`\r\n\r\nBy writing the proof to `proof.json`, you can also verify using \r\n```sh\r\ncurl --location 'https://opacity-ai-zktls-demo.vercel.app/api/verify' \\\r\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n--data @proof.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis invokes a shared mpc-tls session as listed in step 7. \r\n\r\nTesting\r\nAutomated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` and then `packages/adapter-opacity/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nFollow steps in `packages/adapter-opacity/README.md` \r\nStart the client: pnpm start:client\r\nInteract with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\nNo database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\nDiscord username\r\nturetzkyron#0000",

Network Stack\r\n- Defaults to IPv6 (::1) when resolving `localhost`\r\n- More strict separation between localhost and IP address bindings\r\n- Requires explicit permissions for network interface bindings\r\n- More complex security model with Windows Firewall\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- Stricter access control policies\r\n- Requires explicit configuration to allow applications to bind to all interfaces\r\n- May require administrator privileges for certain network operations\r\n- Different handling for IPv4 and IPv6 connections\r\n\r\n3. Common Issues\r\n- EACCES errors when binding to ports\r\n- Permission problems with localhost access\r\n- IPv4/IPv6 conflicts in network applications\r\n- Needs explicit host configuration in development servers\r\n\r\n## macOS Behavior\r\n1. Network Stack\r\n- Unified handling of `localhost` resolution\r\n- Seamless integration between IPv4 and IPv6\r\n- More permissive default network interface bindings\r\n- Simplified security model\r\n\r\n2. Access Control\r\n- More lenient default permissions\r\n- Automatic handling of localhost-to-IP routing\r\n- Better integration between different network interfaces\r\n- Less restrictive port binding policies\r\n\r\n3. Advantages\r\n- \"It just works\" approach to localhost\r\n- Better default security without sacrificing developer experience\r\n- More consistent behavior across different network configurations\r\n- Less configuration needed for development environments\r\n\r\n## Development Impact\r\nThis is why development servers like Vite require different configurations:\r\n- Windows needs `host: true` to allow IP access\r\n- macOS works without special configuration\r\n- Windows often needs explicit IP addresses (127.0.0.1)\r\n- macOS handles localhost resolution more intelligently",

If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. --><!-- ## Why are we doing this?

The intelligence of an AI agent depends on two key factors:\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the underlying AI model.\r\n\r\nThe quality, quantity, and timeliness of the data it processes.\r\n\r\nUsing personal Twitter accounts for scraping data poses significant risks, including account bans and rate limits. This plugin provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution for fetching Twitter data, which has already been validated through millions of executions on Apify.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am offering free usage credits to help developers get started quickly and contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed?\r\nI added a new environment variable and have updated the documentation in all relevant languages. I also explained the purpose of this variable.\r\nTWITTER_API_IO_KEY=\r\n#A third-party Twitter API key for data retrieval. This shared key is for testing only - get your personal key at https://twitterapi.io to avoid QPS limitations\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

Please describe.**\r\nour current implementation lacks support for azure's suite of models, which limits our ability to fully utilize their ecosystem. this creates challenges when integrating with organizations heavily invested in azure for their infrastructure and services. without support for azure models, we're unable to offer flexibility to teams looking to standardize their ai deployments within azure environments.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd support for all azure models across our platform. this includes providing seamless integration for model hosting, training, and inferencing via azure's api and tools. users should be able to deploy and manage models using azure's ecosystem with the same ease and functionality offered for other supported providers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nrelying on third-party middleware or custom solutions to bridge the gap between our platform and azure's services. however, these are often cumbersome and introduce maintenance overhead.\r\ncontinuing to use existing supported providers exclusively, but this limits our ability to work with azure-focused organizations and may push potential users away.\r\ndeveloping an entirely separate module for azure models, though this could lead to fragmentation in our feature set.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nazure is one of the leading cloud platforms, with a growing presence in the ai and ml space. support for azure models would unlock access to their advanced tools like azure machine learning, cognitive services, and integration with microsoft products. this would make our platform more appealing to enterprise customers already using azure for their cloud infrastructure. this could start out as just support for openai in azure but you can imagine how powerful the azure apis could be for using [all of the supported models](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)",

This enhancement supports improved web-based chat capabilities with Eliza characters.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nMee.fun a hosted Eliza service, want to add a web-based chat UI.  In order to do this history of the chat needs to be retrievable.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation. The new API endpoint should be documented in the appropriate API documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the new route added in packages/client-direct/src/api.ts\r\n2. Check the structure of the response in the /agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories endpoint\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Start the server\r\n2. Use a tool like Postman or curl to make a GET request to /agents/{agentId}/{roomId}/memories, replacing {agentId} and {roomId} with valid IDs\r\n3. Verify that the response includes the correct structure with agentId, roomId, and an array of memories\r\n4. Check that each memory in the response includes all the fields from the Memory interface\r\n5. Test with invalid agentId to ensure a 404 response is returned\r\n6. Test with a valid agentId but no memories to ensure an empty array is returned\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\ntreppers\r\n",

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates the **FereAI APIs** using the `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK` module and update the **FerePro Plugin**, enhancing functionality to handle `ChatResponse` objects with better granularity. The primary changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Integration of `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`**:  \r\n   - Added the `fereai-provider` module to support FereAI APIs. Environment variables `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` have been configured accordingly.\r\n   - The provider is available in the `fereai-provider` module and has been installed using `pnpm add fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Imported the default provider instance `fereai` from `fereai-provider` and integrated it into the core and agent system.\r\n   - For more details, refer to the [fereai-provider repository](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider).\r\n\r\n2. **Addition of Helper Utilities and Structured Format Layers for `ChatResponse`**:  \r\n   - Developed utilities to parse and handle `ChatResponse` objects, ensuring consistent formatting and error handling using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n\r\n3. **Integration of `FerePro` Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Enhanced extensibility for plugin responses and logs by incorporating `FerePro` dependencies into the **fereai-provider** module.\r\n\r\n4. **Updates to Core Components**:  \r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/generation.ts` to support generatedText using Vercel AI SDK.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/models.ts` to support FereAI APIs using the model system.\r\n   - Modified `packages/core/src/types.ts` the handle FereAI model.\r\n   - Updated agent handlers to accommodate the new structured response handling.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** | Added FerePro integration using `FereAI Provider for the Vercel AI SDK`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nBegin by reviewing the integration of the `fereai-provider` in the `package.json` and the configuration of the required environment variables. Then, examine the updates made to `packages/core/src/generation.ts`, `packages/core/src/models.ts`, `packages/core/src/types.ts` and the `agent/src/index.ts` handlers under API configurations to understand the response handling.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. **Setup Environment Variables**:  \r\n   - Ensure that `FEREAI_USER_ID` and `FEREAI_API_KEY` are correctly set in the environment.\r\n\r\n2. **Install Dependencies**:  \r\n   - Run `pnpm add` to install the new `fereai-provider` module.\r\n\r\n3. **Run Unit Tests**:  \r\n   - Execute the `fereai-provider` test suite to verify that all existing and new tests pass successfully.\r\n   - For `fereai-provider` tests, refer to the [fereai-provider tests](https://github.com/sekmet/fereai-provider/blob/main/packages/fereai/src/fereai.test.ts).\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing**:  \r\n   - Interact with the chatbot to ensure that responses are handled correctly and that the integration with FereAI APIs functions as expected using `fereai-provider`.\r\n   - Monitor logs to confirm that structured logging is operational and that no errors related to the new integration occur.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged.

This misconception caused a public relations disaster and raised concerns about the AI's autonomy. As a result, the team had to make logs public to maintain transparency and trust.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be mitigated using zkTLS. zkTLS enables the generation of zero-knowledge proofs for TLS sessions, also known as \"web proofs.\" With zkTLS, any off-chain data can be proven either on-chain or off-chain, ensuring authenticity without compromising privacy.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Reclaim as an adapter into the framework without introducing breaking changes. Reclaim is a zkTLS platform built on EigenLayer as an Actively Validated Service (AVS).\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nUpdates \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis update addresses the critical need for transparency and trust in AI interactions, as highlighted by the PR disaster involving aixbt. By integrating **Reclaim** as a zkTLS adapter, we ensure that all inferences and interactions are verifiable without compromising privacy. This addition strengthens the framework's credibility by enabling zero-knowledge proof generation and verification for TLS sessions.\r\n\r\nThe integration aligns with EigenLayer's mission to build secure and verifiable systems, leveraging **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** to enhance both functionality and trustworthiness. This is especially relevant as more AI systems require robust mechanisms to prove autonomy and authenticity in a seamless and privacy-preserving manner.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in the adapter-reclaim README.\r\nNo further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Proof Verification Example\r\nBelow is a screenshot showcasing the generated proof and its verification process:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 39 17\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c64b01-47b1-4ece-8624-9b65e7624f66\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 11 31 20\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d41d675e-9249-4c46-9f12-396f02b7d8b2\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure the following environment variables (generated from the [Reclaim Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)):\r\n```\r\n# Reclaim Protocol\r\nRECLAIM_APP_ID= # Reclaim App ID\r\nRECLAIM_APP_SECRET= # Reclaim App Secret\r\n\r\n# Verifiable Inference Configuration\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_ENABLED=true # Set to true to enable verifiable inference\r\nVERIFIABLE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER=reclaim # Options: reclaim, opacity (soon)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run a character using the command:\r\n\r\n`pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"`\r\n\r\n3. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n4. Interact with the agent via chat and check the logs for proof generation and verification.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- Automated tests are sufficient; no manual testing is required for deployment.\r\n- No database changes or additional deployment instructions are necessary.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n--> Gajesh#0000\r\n",

            "body": "# Risks\r\nLow. Existing users who relied on Deepgram by default will still see no change unless they explicitly define a new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`. Fallback logic preserves original behavior (Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- **Adds** an optional `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` setting (`deepgram`, `openai`, or `local`) with fallback logic.  \r\n  - If not set, old behavior remains: Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local.\r\n- **Moves** Twitter Spaces plugins from `agent-twitter-client` into this repo for better flexibility and less friction in plugin development.\r\n- **Introduces** an AI-driven Twitter Spaces flow:\r\n  1. **Automatic** Space launch decisions (random chance, business hours, cooldown intervals).\r\n  2. **Multi-speaker** logic with queue management (`maxSpeakers`).\r\n  3. GPT-based filler/idle messages, optional STT/TTS bridging, local audio recording.\r\n  4. Graceful shutdown and cooldown for repeated Spaces.\r\n\r\n### Transcription Service Changes\r\n- We introduced a new **`TranscriptionProvider` enum** (`Deepgram`, `OpenAI`, or `Local`) to replace string flags.\r\n- In `initialize()`, the **provider is chosen in this order**:\r\n  1. `character.settings.transcription` (if the API keys exist),\r\n  2. `.env` (`TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER`),\r\n  3. Old fallback logic (Deepgram \u2192 OpenAI \u2192 Local) if neither is configured.\r\n- For example, in your `character.json`, you can specify:\r\n  ```json5\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  If you have `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` set, the service will use Deepgram; otherwise it continues to the next check.\r\n- `processQueue()` uses a `switch` on `this.transcriptionProvider` to pick the final method (`transcribeWithDeepgram`, `transcribeWithOpenAI`, or `transcribeLocally`).\r\n\r\n## Flow Recap\r\n1. **Periodic Check**  \r\n   - If no Space is running, possibly launch one by `shouldLaunchSpace()` (random chance, business hours, cooldown).  \r\n   - If a Space is running, `manageCurrentSpace()` handles speaker timeouts, occupancy updates, queue acceptance, etc.\r\n\r\n2. **Space Creation**  \r\n   - Generates a `SpaceConfig` (topics from config or GPT).  \r\n   - Attaches plugins: audio recording, STT/TTS, idle monitor, etc.  \r\n   - Hooks into `speakerRequest`, `occupancyUpdate`, `idleTimeout`, etc.\r\n\r\n3. **Speaker Logic**  \r\n   - Maintains an `activeSpeakers` array + a queue if at capacity (`maxSpeakers`).  \r\n   - Enforces `speakerMaxDurationMs` per speaker.  \r\n   - If a speaker is removed, accept next in queue if available.\r\n\r\n4. **Stopping**  \r\n   - `stopSpace()` finalizes the Space, logs completion, clears states, etc.  \r\n   - Resumes periodic checks at a slower interval until the next launch is decided.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### A) `.env` / Environment Variables\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Transcription Provider\r\nTRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=         # Default is local (possible values: deepgram, openai, local)\r\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\r\nDEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) `character.json` \u2192 `\"twitterSpaces\"` Field\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"transcription\": \"Deepgram\"\r\n  }\r\n  \"twitterSpaces\": {\r\n    \"maxSpeakers\": 2,\r\n    \"topics\": [\r\n      \"Blockchain Trends\",\r\n      \"AI Innovations\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"typicalDurationMinutes\": 45,\r\n    \"idleKickTimeoutMs\": 300000,\r\n    \"minIntervalBetweenSpacesMinutes\": 60,\r\n    \"businessHoursOnly\": true,\r\n    \"randomChance\": 0.3,\r\n    \"enableIdleMonitor\": true,\r\n    \"enableSttTts\": true,\r\n    \"enableRecording\": false,\r\n    \"voiceId\": \"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\",\r\n    \"sttLanguage\": \"en\",\r\n    \"gptModel\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\r\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful AI co-host assistant.\",\r\n    \"speakerMaxDurationMs\": 240000\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`maxSpeakers`**: number of concurrent speakers allowed.\r\n- **`topics`**: if none are provided, GPT generates them dynamically.\r\n- **`randomChance`**: probability for each check cycle to spawn a new Space.\r\n- **`speakerMaxDurationMs`**: maximum time each speaker can speak before removal.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Features** (new Twitter Spaces integration and optional transcription provider).\r\n- **Improvements** (unified plugin development, more config options, fallback logic maintained).\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, minimal. We must mention:\r\n- The new `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (optional).\r\n- The new `twitterSpaces` config section in `character.json`.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Check `transcription.service.ts` to review how it resolves conflicts by prioritizing character settings, then `.env`, then old fallback.\r\n- Check new or relocated Twitter Spaces integration files for the Space lifecycle (launch, speaker management, idle detection, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Define `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` in `.env` (or leave it empty to keep old fallback).\r\n2. Provide valid API keys if choosing `deepgram` or `openai`.\r\n3. Define `twitterSpaces.randomChance` in the character JSON to `1` (for a 100% rate of starting a space).\r\n4. Run the agent; verify that Spaces launch automatically, respect the chosen transcription provider, and handle multi-speaker logic as expected.\r\n\r\nNo special database migrations are needed. Basic local runs and logs confirm correct functioning.\r\n\r\n# Future Improvements\r\n\r\n- **More robust decision logic** for accepting speakers, switching, and timeouts.  \r\n- **Realtime API plugin** for smoother, on-the-fly conversation handling.  \r\n- **Solo Broadcast Mode**: launch Spaces focused on a single host monologue with no external speakers.  \r\n- **True VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to detect when a speaker finishes talking, instead of relying on manual mute/unmute cues.  \r\n- **Advanced scheduling triggers** (e.g., event-based or calendar-based).  \r\n- **Analytics & insights** for post-Space summaries or usage metrics.\r\n\r\n---",

I suspect this is because with many of the PRs their changes are well isolated in the code base.\r\n\r\nOn the value side of this change, I would say that this caused me quite a bit of confusion until I finally dug into the code and found that tableName was not in fact a reference to a table name at all.  When I asked in the forum unfortunately nobody was able to answer me.  Given the project is still so early... and more developer coming... the value of more rapidly understanding the system multiplied by all those developers reaching productivity a bit faster is real value.

List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nThe feature request was to develop a default characterfile with associated functionality (actions, etc) to serve as the monitor for a new devs channel, that will:\r\n\r\n- [x] Answers FAQ-style questions using repo knowledge as recommended first step\r\n- [x] Suggests relevant examples based on current work\r\n- [x] Guides contributors to relevant documentation/contributors with answers\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- [x] New default characterfile `shaiw.character.json` and associated `plugin-code-assistant`\r\n- [x] Provides a discord agent (shaiw) that has been trained on Shaw's bio, lore, and character...\r\n    - [x] Used 8 recent videos and interviews and AI to pull out bio, lore, adjectives, knowledge, etc... \r\n- [x] Listen for questions (which are often repetitive), answer with patient, teaching tone, but slight sense of humor (like Shaw).\r\n- [x] Search Github for answers concerning issues or PRs\r\n- [x] Search Github Docs Site for answers (loads entire site into vectordb during initial load)\r\n- [x] Search knowledge for previous answers on discord\r\n- [x] Stores all knowledge in vectordb for fast retrieval \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes, I provided a README.md file in the packages/plugin-code-assistant folder (where most changes are)\r\nI suggested a minor update to the existing documentation, pointing to that README.md (done)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\npnpm test (most test from other plugins failed, not sure what to do about that)\r\npnpm lint (new files have all necessary fixes made, there were issues with other plugins)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review code updates, most are in the `packages/plugin-code-assistant` folder, but also notice the new `shaiw.character.json` in the `characters` folder.\r\n2. Notice that a minor change was required in `packages/core/src/knowlede.ts` to add functionality to bypass the knowledge search.  This was required as the core files were searching the knowledge in parallel to my new plugin checking and both were responding.  So, I toggled that default knowledge search on and off with a new `skipKnowledge` message.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Notice that I still have a sqlite db set, as I did not know how you want to put it into production, change that in characterfile, as neccesary.\r\n2. Notice that you will need a GITHUB_TOKEN (either will do, I used a personal one)... this is to get past the rate limiting of making calls with Ocokit without an API key).  You will need to add that to .env and .env.sample going forward (done).\r\n3. update .env with your:\r\n\r\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for plugin)\r\n- GITHUB_TOKEN (required for plugin)\r\n- DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID\r\n- DISCORD_API_TOKEN\r\n\r\n4. Standard install and build. (I had a recent PR merged into elizaOS/develop that included these script calls):\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm clean && pnpm install && pnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm start --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin (with new database)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the plugin (with new database and in debug mode)\r\n\r\n```\r\npnpm cleanstart:debug --characters characters/shaiw.character.json\r\n```\r\n8. Please let me know if anything is broke when you test it, it worked well on my end.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

For example, grok image generation API is not publicly available yet, so when asking my character to generate an image, it defaulted to openAI but that code was not set. It is not clear to developers that this is possible (the image gen using a different fallback than the base LLM). In the case where the image model is provided but does not work, it will assume the underlying access token is openAI, and will use groks token. I think this will extend to all other models where the image model API is not aligned with this `core/generation` file. \r\n\r\nI have added some logging and a bit of logic to improve this and will take ownership of integrating grok image gen when it becomes publicly available, I am following along development in the xAI discord. \r\n\r\nCurrently seeking repo permissions to submit the PR for the enhancement to `packages/core/src/generation` and to add grok image gen capability when it becomes available. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSet character model to grok and ask it to generate an image, user will receive error message pointing to openAI env keys not being set. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nUser is informed that the image does not exist or will not match the base model, and that it will default to OPENAI\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"785\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 01 19\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9110b36-391d-4fb6-8012-e81fa4e7a8c9\" />\r\n<img width=\"347\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 01 46\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e522d338-1b16-49d4-9a0e-78e547101f9a\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n",

This should be removed so that character card bios can be updated upon restart.  There's not much of a performance gain from caching anyway, as the bio is only loaded once on startup.\r\n\r\ntwitter login Cookies are also cached indefinitely, not sure if that's good or bad, but it doesn't seem right to me as twitter login cookies should eventually expire.",

                "body": "Investigation Summary:\r\n\r\n    PostgresDatabaseAdapter Initialization:\r\n        The PostgresDatabaseAdapter class in packages/adapter-postgres/src/index.ts is responsible for managing the PostgreSQL database connection and operations. It includes methods for initializing the database, handling errors, and executing queries.\r\n\r\n    Schema Initialization:\r\n        During the init method, the adapter checks if certain tables exist and attempts to initialize the schema by executing SQL scripts. This is where the extension setup might be happening.\r\n\r\n    Potential Issue:\r\n        If the vector extension is being created in the schema initialization process and it already exists, it would lead to the duplicate key error you're seeing.\r\n\r\nRecommended Steps:\r\n\r\n    Check Schema Files:\r\n        Review the schema.sql file in the adapter-postgres package to see if there are any CREATE EXTENSION commands for the vector extension. Ensure that these commands are wrapped in a conditional check to prevent re-creation if the extension already exists.\r\n\r\n    Modify Initialization Logic:\r\n        Update the initialization logic to check for the existence of the extension before attempting to create it. This can be done using a query like:\r\n\r\n        DO $$ BEGIN\r\n            IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector') THEN\r\n                CREATE EXTENSION vector;\r\n            END IF;\r\n        END $$;\r\n\r\n    Database Cleanup:\r\n        As a temporary workaround, manually drop the vector extension from your database and let the initialization process recreate it. Use the following command in your PostgreSQL database:\r\n\r\n        DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS vector;\r\n\r\n"

            "body": "**Description**\r\nAdding a new type of \u201cswarm agent\u201d to the Eliza framework. The goal is to allow multiple agents to coordinate on tasks in a way similar to how single-character agents are currently configured, while supporting unique swarm features such as collective decision-making and interactions among multiple agents.\r\n\r\n**Motivation & Rationale**\r\n\r\nEliza currently supports single \u201ccharacter\u201d agents with various providers, settings, and behaviours.\r\nA natural next step is to introduce the ability for multiple agents to work collectively (swarm) on tasks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Feature Requirements**\r\n\r\n1. Swarm Agent Configuration\r\n\r\n_Support a dedicated configuration block for swarm agents in a manner similar to single-character agents._\r\n\r\n Allow specifying:\r\n- Number of agents in the swarm.\r\n- Provider definitions for each agent (could be the same or different).\r\n- Traditional settings (e.g., roles, personas, capabilities).\r\n- Additional swarm-specific settings (e.g., rules for agent coordination, speaker settings, collective decision-making thresholds).`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Create Swarm Logic.\r\n\r\n- Configure and Execute swarms by importing the core package in external projects.\r\n- Allow all supported clients to use swarm logic without disrupting current flows(ex: the last agent in a twitter maker team will post as a singular agent akin to current implementation).\r\n- Write dedicated test suite or carefully extend the current tests to confirm proper handling of the majority of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Document feature:\r\n\r\n- How multiple agents can be spawned and coordinated. \r\n- How tasks or sub-tasks are delegated among swarm agents (e.g., parallel vs. sequential).\r\n- How swarm memory storage works.\r\n- Document possible flows.\r\n- How can the utility be extended further. \r\n\r\n",

This occurs when using plugin-image-generation to generating images as well. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce using the ImageGenerationPlugin:\r\n\r\nEnable the twitter client for your character along with an appropriate API key for image generation. Reply to a post of the Agent on twitter with \"Please generate an image of a cute cat!\" - it should trigger the GENERATE_IMAGE action. This will cause the TypeError to occur.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI am unsure what the expected behavior should be. I would expect the callback to be able to take the Content object and pass it back to the client from which the action  was initiated from and some content text to be returned to the conversation that initiated the action.\r\n",

Run `docker build -t latest .`\r\n2.
