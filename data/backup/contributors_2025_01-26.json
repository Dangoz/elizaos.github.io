Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window.

This PR introduces a Gelato Relay plugin with support for both `sponsoredCall` and `sponsoredCallERC2771` functionalities.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large. List what kind of risks and what could be affected.\r\n-->\r\n**Risk Level**: Low  \r\nThis change introduces a self-contained plugin for interacting with Gelato Relay. It does not affect existing systems or workflows.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin to interact with Gelato Relay for EVM-compatible blockchains. It supports:\r\n\r\n- **sponsoredCall**: Allows gasless contract interactions.\r\n- **sponsoredCallERC2771**: Supports transactions with ERC2771 meta-transactions.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Feature**: Adds new functionality for interacting with Gelato Relay via `sponsoredCall` and `sponsoredCallERC2771`.  \r\n- **Improvements**: Includes a robust schema validation system for user inputs and examples for both transaction types.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- **Yes**:  \r\n  Documentation is included in the `README.md` file, covering setup instructions, environment variables, and usage examples.  \r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the `utils.ts` file for the core `sponsoredCall` and `sponsoredCallERC2771` implementations.\r\n2. Review the `action.ts` file to see how these utilities integrate with the plugin.\r\n3. Ensure that the input prompt handling in the `handler` function meets expectations.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Test Case 1: `sponsoredCall`\r\n1. Use the following input prompt:\r\n   ```text\r\n   Call increment() on 0x3890DB55ff538FBF281c9152820A4a748f5D6F21 contract:\r\n   - Function Name: increment\r\n   - Args: []\r\n   - Target: 0x3890DB55ff538FBF281c9152820A4a748f5D6F21\r\n   - Chain: arbitrumSepolia\r\n   - ABI: [\"function increment()\"]\r\n   ```\r\n2. Verify that the transaction completes successfully and the task status link is generated.\r\n\r\n### Test Case 2: `sponsoredCallERC2771`\r\n1. Use the following input prompt:\r\n   ```text\r\n   Call increment() on 0x00172f67db60E5fA346e599cdE675f0ca213b47b contract:\r\n   - Function Name: increment\r\n   - Args: []\r\n   - Target: 0x00172f67db60E5fA346e599cdE675f0ca213b47b\r\n   - Chain: arbitrumSepolia\r\n   - ABI: [\"function increment()\"]\r\n   - User: 0x23e359eCAB56210f4b8B559218C4d27A85b052b8\r\n   ```\r\n2. Verify that the user is included in the relay request and the task status link is generated.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Environment Variables\r\nEnsure the following environment variables are configured:\r\n- `GELATO_RELAY_API_KEY`: Your Gelato Relay API key.\r\n- `EVM_PROVIDER_URL`: RPC endpoint URL for EVM-compatible networks.\r\n- `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for signing transactions.\r\n\r\n# Discord username\r\n\r\nIf you have further questions, join us on Discord: **[[Discord Link](https://discord.gg/ai16z)](https://discord.gg/ai16z)**  \r\nContributor: `@anirudhmakhana`  ",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

            "body": "**Describe the bug**  \nThe `msg_id` and `agent_id` are used to create a UUID for messages, leading to potential collisions:  \n\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/227baf7bd62394a50ae261e934669e4a9520b87f/packages/client-telegram/src/messageManager.ts#L1266C2-L1268C23\n\n```typescript\nconst messageId = stringToUuid(message.message_id.toString() + \"-\" + this.runtime.agentId) as UUID;\n```\n\nIf the same `msg_id` is used in a different channel, the agent incorrectly assumes the memory already exists and skips creating a new memory:  \n\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/227baf7bd62394a50ae261e934669e4a9520b87f/packages/core/src/memory.ts#L172C1-L190C6\n\n```typescript\nasync createMemory(memory: Memory, unique = false): Promise<void> {\n    // TODO: check memory.agentId == this.runtime.agentId\n\n    const existingMessage =\n        await this.runtime.databaseAdapter.getMemoryById(memory.id);\n\n    if (existingMessage) {\n        elizaLogger.debug(\"Memory already exists, skipping\");\n        return;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**  \n1. Use the same `msg_id` in a different chat or channel (e.g., in Telegram).  \n2. Attempt to create a memory for the new message.  \n3. Observe that the memory creation is skipped due to the `msg_id` collision.  \n\n**Expected behavior**  \nMemory creation should account for different channels or rooms. The system should generate a unique `UUID` by including the `room_id` in the `msg_id` creation process to avoid collisions.  \n\n**Screenshots**  \n\nWe encountered an issue in Telegram where the message already existed for a different user.\n\n### A log before memory creation:\n\n<img width=\"1091\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c659c325-55aa-424e-aa68-2423754229b0\" />\n\n### It's clearly visible that even with the same message ID, the room and user are different:\n\n<img width=\"860\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d2a1e1f-a56a-4bbd-851c-e9fcd08d5fbc\" />\n\n**Suggested solution**    \nA potential solution would be updating the UUID creation logic to replace `agent_id ` with `room_id` in addition to `msg_id` becuase `room_id` is generated based on `agent_id` already. However, further research is needed to confirm whether collisions involving `room_id` are possible.  \n\nAlso further investigation is needed to verify if collisions are possible in other clients.",

The issue persists after verifying that all tokens, configurations, and permissions are correct.\n\nIn previous builds of ElizaOS, I was able to get my character to interact successfully through the webpage, so it doesn't appear to be an OpenAI issue - this current build, my web client never seems to connect. I'm starting the server with the --host switch (as it's being run on a headless VPS running current version of Ubuntu.).\n\nI've verified I'm running proper Node versions, no warnings on load of either character file or server.\n\nI can supply any logs, and I'll post my (api redacted) character file in the first comment.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nDo a fresh install of v0.1.8 build 1\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nNormal conversation, I guess?\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1706719-d252-476d-8c4c-4cd91ec30331)\n\n",
