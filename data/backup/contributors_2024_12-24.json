An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Enable @elizaos/plugin-solana in the character.\r\n2. Interact with the Agent, for example: \u201cMy address is HqvTPqS2FaB2fQ7mxqZHQHz6H28o1u2Z9fRH5No8JN2W and I want to stake 0.01 SOL\u201d.\r\n3.

I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Description: \u201cact\u201d is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n\u2022 How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n\u2022 Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that \u201cact\u201d may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n\u2022 How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

I have also updated the .env.example to include the additional variables for the mongo connection. And added to the agent index with functionality to initialise this database if required. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nAdding an additional feature \r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Any context or related work?\r\nIn my day job we exclusively use mongoDB for our database needs, for commercials and performance reasons. As we want to develop AI Agents, we need to have the mongoDB adaptor. IN the sprit of OpenSource I wanted to make sure it was available for the whole community to use as well. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nA small additional input to the documentation is required to make users aware of the additional functionality and how it can be actioned. \r\nSimilar to the Postgres set up just adding in the appropriate connection string to the .env file will action he change to start using MongoDB as the database. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThe reviewer will need to have a least  a free account with mongoDB atlas, then add the connection string and a Database name to the .env file. After that the agent should run as expected, saving memories as before. The reviewer can verify the saved data inside the MongoDB interface. \r\n \r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create MongoDB atlas account \r\n2. Add connection string and Database name to .env file \r\n3. Run agent \r\n4. Verify inside MongoDB interface that the collections have formed and data is being stored \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\njoby3186\r\n-->\r\n",

The main risks are:\r\n- Failed tweets due to rate limiting or authentication issues\r\n- Potential for tweets that are too long (mitigated by automatic truncation)\r\n- No risk to existing functionality as this is an isolated plugin\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a Twitter plugin that enables posting tweets through the agent-twitter-client package. Key features:\r\n- Implements POST_TWEET action for sending tweets\r\n- Handles Twitter authentication via environment variables\r\n- Automatically truncates tweets that exceed character limits\r\n- Provides detailed error handling and logging\r\n- Supports dry run mode for testing\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds new Twitter posting capability\r\n- Uses the standalone agent-twitter-client package\r\n- Implements proper error handling and character limit enforcement\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n- Add Twitter plugin setup instructions\r\n- Document required environment variables:\r\n  - TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n  - TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n  - TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n  - TWITTER_DRY_RUN (optional)\r\n  - TWITTER_2FA_SECRET (optional)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review `packages/plugin-twitter/src/actions/post.ts` for the main implementation\r\n2. Check error handling in postTweet function\r\n3. Review tweet composition logic in composeTweet function\r\n4. Verify environment variable handling\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n```bash\r\nTWITTER_USERNAME=your_username\r\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=your_password\r\nTWITTER_EMAIL=your_email\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=false\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test tweet posting:\r\n```bash\r\n# Start with dry run mode\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=true pnpm dev\r\n\r\n# Test actual posting\r\nTWITTER_DRY_RUN=false pnpm dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify error handling:\r\n- Try posting a tweet > 180 characters (should truncate)\r\n- Try posting with invalid credentials (should show error)\r\n- Try posting with missing credentials (should validate)\r\n\r\n4. Check logging:\r\n- Verify credential validation logs\r\n- Check tweet content generation logs\r\n- Verify error messages are descriptive\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n- Requires agent-twitter-client package\r\n- Environment variables must be set for Twitter authentication\r\n- No database changes required",

            "body": "This is my first attempt to contribute to this project. I have been adding features and additional query capability for the Birdeye API and I think many other could benefit.\r\n\r\n# Relates to:\r\n\r\n- plugin ecosystem and capabilities for accessing and querying Birdeye data API\r\n- [Expanding Birdeye thread](https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1318974518680748173)\r\n- possible overlap with: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1366\r\n\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n- People who already have the BIRDEYE_API_KEY enabled could end up querying the endpoints more\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nThis pull request significantly enhances the Birdeye API integration within the AI agent framework by expanding its capabilities beyond basic query functionality. The proposed tools enable more comprehensive and versatile interactions with the Birdeye API, including data clearing and management features. These improvements provide the AI agents with a broader and more efficient toolkit for handling Birdeye API data, enhancing the overall flexibility and utility of the framework for developers and end-users. By extending the scope of the API integration, this contribution supports more robust and scalable solutions within the project.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds providers that represent all the different API endpoints available in the Birdeye API. By doing so, it ensures that when a user requests a specific type of data, the AI agent has a significantly higher likelihood of accessing and utilizing the relevant data in its response. This enhancement maximizes the agent\u2019s ability to provide accurate and contextually rich answers, leveraging the full scope of the Birdeye API.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- net new plugin\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis API connection is critical for enabling the agent to perform research and analyze the dynamics of the ecosystem effectively. By integrating comprehensive access to all Birdeye API endpoints, this PR lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that will further expand the agent's capabilities. This integration not only empowers the agent to deliver more insightful and accurate responses but also positions the framework for scalable growth and the addition of advanced functionalities in the future.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a document change is needed, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Yes, this will require the docs to be updated. I am happy to update the appropriate project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- Pull the branch\r\n- Enable plugin by setting the BIRDEYE_API_KEY\r\n- Utilize the web console as ask questions about onchain data. \r\n- Example prompts:\r\n-- give me a list of wallets on solana that i should be following\r\n-- tell me more about BbJgE7HZMaDp5NTYvRh5jZSkQPVDTU8ubPFtpogUkEj4\r\n-- what are the top gainers today\r\n-- what is the current price of HIPPO?\r\n-- what tokens are tredning today on sui? \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged.
