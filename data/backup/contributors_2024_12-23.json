            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using the Eliza framework, I successfully configured the Twitter client and logged into my account. However, upon inspecting the runtime logs, I noticed that the message `[\"\u25ce Next tweet scheduled in 128 minutes\"] ` appeared twice. This indicates that `generateNewTweetLoop` was called twice, resulting in two independent tweet scheduling loops being initialized.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs because the `start` method in `/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts` calls `generateNewTweetLoop` twice\u2014once at line 174 and again at line 190\u2014without any conditional checks to prevent multiple timers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add the following code to the relevant `character.json` file:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   \"clients\": [\"twitter\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the Twitter-related parameters in the `.env` file, and set `POST_IMMEDIATELY=true` to enable immediate tweet posting.\r\n\r\n3. Start the model service.\r\n\r\n4. Check Twitter, and you will find that two tweets are posted simultaneously. Additionally, the logs show the message `Next tweet scheduled in xxx minutes` printed twice.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe generateNewTweetLoop method should only be invoked once during the start method, ensuring that only a single tweet scheduling loop is active. This would prevent duplicate logs and redundant scheduling timers.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebe87aa-ff46-488d-9961-90daf43b5aab\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- File: /packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\n- Method: start\r\n- Lines: 174 and 190\r\n- Observed Behavior: generateNewTweetLoop is called twice without a conditional check, causing two scheduling loops to be initialized.\r\n- Move second generateNewTweetLoop() inside the if (enableActionProcessing)",

Update `generateText` API to be able to pass through tool options to leverage the model's tool calling capabilities\r\n2. Update the GOAT plugin to use tool calling allowing it to perform complex onchain actions that require multiple steps. Now developers can define high level actions (swap, bet on Polymarket, stake, etc.) and GOAT will take care of handling each action (see the screenshots below)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and build it\r\n2. Set up the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` and `EVM_PROVIDER_URL` env variables\r\n3. Uncomment lines 70-72 in the `actions.ts` file in the GOAT plugin\r\n4. Prompt the agent with \"Swap 0.1 USDC for MODE using KIM in a single hop\"\r\n5. In the agent logs you should see all the different steps that the agent is making\r\n6. The tx should fail unless you have ETH and USDC in MODE :)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\nAgent can just do one function call so you need to specify the inputs like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11cec757-fdb1-43b8-affc-562380a38184)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After\r\nAgent can do multiple function calls in an action so inputs are more human friendly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f80382c-f48f-4096-a2ab-a2cafa72477d)\r\n\r\nIn the background you can also log all the different tool interactions:\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-23 at 16 24 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/627792d8-eeb7-4110-b2ef-33dd8c83f3da\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\naguspunk\r\n",

            "body": "Title: Standardize boolean values and fix pattern for .env file\r\n\r\nDescribe the bug\r\nThe `.env` file contains some inconsistencies in how boolean values and specific strings are represented. For instance, the variable `POST_IMMEDIATELY` uses the string \"NO\", while a boolean value like `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE` uses `false`. This inconsistency could lead to parsing issues and is prone to human error. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n1. Open the `.env` file. 2. Observe that `POST_IMMEDIATELY=NO` is used instead of the expected `false`. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n Boolean variables should consistently use `true` or `false`, and all string-based boolean values such as `POST_IMMEDIATELY` should use `true`/`false` instead of `\"YES\"`/`\"NO\"`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\n This change will standardize boolean values, making the `.env` file easier to parse and reducing the risk of errors. The `parseBooleanFromText` function, declared as `const parseBooleanFromText: (text: string) => boolean;`, can be used outside the `.env` context to ensure boolean parsing is consistent across the codebase. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for .env values\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean values**: Always use `true` or `false` (not `\"YES\"` or `\"NO\"`). \r\nExample: ``` TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true POST_IMMEDIATELY=false ``` \r\n\r\n Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and make it easier for automated scripts to process the `.env` file while reduce  human error.",

            "body": "# Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to extend Eliza's capabilities with FerePro Agent. FerePro is an agent developed by [FereAI](https://www.fereai.xyz) which can perform open world Q&A related to various crypto topics like - Token Research, Investment Decisions, KOL research, category research, actions (swap, trade and more). It can interpret and answer questions of various complexities. We believe that adding this as a plugin will significantly improve Eliza's capabilities to perform research and Q&A.\r\n\r\n# Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA Plugin for FerePro in Eliza's codebase.\r\n\r\n# Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAs an alternate, we will need to add a lot of tools and multi agentic capabilities to Eliza. FerePro can abstract all of that. \r\nDisclaimer: I'm a co founder and core dev at FereAI.\r\n\r\n# Additional context\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n1. FerePro APIs can provide streaming answer as well as non streaming answer. This plugin must support both the use cases.\r\n2. FerePro APIs also provide a bunch of intermediate responses. This is usually shown in UI for users to get a view of happenings behind the scenes. They should only be enabled when this plugin is run in debug mode. Developers can use this info to troubleshoot or get support from Fere team.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n1. Developers will need to [get API keys from FereAI](https://docs.fereai.xyz/docs/api/api_access). \r\n3. This key must be passed to the plugin for it to work.\r\n4. FerePro is a freemium API. There is a limit on questions that can be asked for free. (We can revise the limits based on community feedback). For extended use cases, the developers must top up their account by visiting fereai.xyz.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nTypeScript type error in Slack client when handling message attachments. The error occurs because the `attachments` property in the `Content` interface expects an array of `Media` type objects, but the code was only providing a subset of the required properties.\r\n\r\n**Error message:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ text: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Media[]'.\r\nType '{ text: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Media': id, url, title, source, description\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the Slack client implementation.\r\n2. Try to create a message content with attachments.\r\n3. The code attempts to create an attachment with only the `text` property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent ? [{ text: attachmentContent }] : undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code should properly implement the `Media` type interface by providing all required properties:\r\n\r\n- `id` (string)\r\n- `url` (string)\r\n- `title` (string)\r\n- `source` (string)\r\n- `description` (string)\r\n- `text` (string)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the attachment creation to include all required `Media` type properties:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent\r\n    ? [{\r\n        id: stringToUuid(`${event.ts}-attachment`),\r\n        url: '',  // Since this is text content, no URL is needed\r\n        title: 'Text Attachment',\r\n        source: 'slack',\r\n        description: 'Text content from Slack message',\r\n        text: attachmentContent\r\n    }]\r\n    : undefined,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue affects the Slack client's message handling functionality in the `packages/client-slack/src/messages.ts` file. The fix ensures type safety while maintaining the intended functionality of handling text attachments from Slack messages.",
