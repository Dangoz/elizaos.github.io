List what kind of risks and what could be affected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdded type safety to evaluators in `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` to prevent crashes when `parseJsonArrayFromText` returns null. The fix uses `evaluators?.includes` to handle potential null values. Since `strictNullChecks` is disabled, similar issues likely exist elsewhere. I enabled `strictNullChecks` in the core package and kept changes minimal, focusing on the core runtime. Downstream TypeScript errors were addressed with `ts-expect-error` pragmas. This approach facilitates the incremental adoption of stricter type safety.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nTypescript related\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why.

This feature is particularly useful for organizations using Eliza to manage their Twitter accounts, as it provides an additional layer of control by requiring approval before any content goes live.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nThe approval mechanism is being introduced to address the needs of organizations and teams that require greater control over the content being published via their Twitter accounts. By adding this feature, we enable a structured review process to ensure that tweets align with brand guidelines, organizational policies, and quality standards before they are made public.\r\n\r\n#### Context or Related Work\r\n- Use Case in Organizations: Many organizations rely on collaborative content creation but need an approval layer to prevent accidental or inappropriate tweets from being posted.\r\n- Extending Eliza's Utility: This feature enhances Eliza's value for enterprise-level usage by making it a more robust tool for social media management.\r\n- Precedent in Social Media Management Tools: Other tools like Buffer or Hootsuite provide similar approval workflows, demonstrating its importance for structured social media management.\r\n- Consistency and Accountability: Helps maintain a record of approvals and ensures accountability for all published content.\r\n- User Feedback: This feature was designed in response to user feedback requesting an approval mechanism for improved content governance.\r\nThis enhancement aligns with the broader goal of making Eliza a versatile and enterprise-friendly platform for managing social media channels effectively.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![IMG_1686](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a3423a9-25eb-4cc0-9492-9059ac4d2da3)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deployment, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste command line output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Please specify deploy instructions if there is something more than the automated steps. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for the contributor role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->\r\n",

This plugin acts as a bridge between AI agents and the real world, enabling real-time data access and device control.\r\n\r\n### Key Features:\r\n1. **DePINScan Integration**:\r\n   - Fetches and caches real-time data from the IoTeX DePINScan API.\r\n   - Provides aggregated daily metrics, detailed project data, and market information for DePIN projects.\r\n\r\n2. **Weather Integration**:\r\n   - Nubila APIs to fetch and analyze current weather and forecasts for specified locations.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- **Features**: \r\n  - A completely new plugin added to the Eliza Agent Framework.\r\n- **Documentation**: \r\n  - Detailed setup instructions provided in the README to help users integrate and use the plugin effectively.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThe IoTeX team provides the DEPIN+AI layer to bridge decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) with artificial intelligence, enabling transformative real-world applications. **`@elizaos/plugin-depin`** plugin is designed to expand the capabilities of Eliza agents by connecting them with DePINs, enabling them to process real-world data and perform actionable tasks.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes include the plugin's README, which serves as comprehensive documentation for setup and usage. No additional documentation changes are required.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the plugin's code for integration with DePINScan, Mapbox, and Nubila APIs.\r\n2. Follow the README's configuration and setup instructions to verify the plugin's functionality.\r\n3. Test both actions (`DEPIN_PROJECTS` and `CURRENT_WEATHER`) to ensure correct behavior.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Test `DEPIN_PROJECTS` action with:\r\n   - Query token prices, market caps, and valuations.\r\n   - Compare metrics and filter projects by categories and chains.\r\n   - Ask device statistics and earnings data.\r\n   - Question about specific DePIN project details.\r\n\r\n2. Test `CURRENT_WEATHER` action to:\r\n   - Fetch current weather conditions, temperature, and forecasts\r\n   - Analyze and answer weather-related questions, including patterns and trends.\r\n   - Ensure proper handling of weather-themed queries, including memes and visual content generation.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### DePIN project info:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 1 22 08\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f302c8fc-6097-458f-89bc-25d716dc3325\" />\r\n\r\n### Weather data \r\n\r\n<img width=\"747\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 1 22 31\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/056323e2-db96-44da-97e0-eed10f41bf88\" />\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n**nikita_zhou**",

Insecure Secret Management\r\n**Location**: `getTokenForProvider()` function and environment variable handling\r\n**Impact**: Critical\r\n**Description**: The code exposes multiple API keys and sensitive credentials through environment variables without proper encryption or secure storage.\r\n```typescript\r\nreturn (\r\n    character.settings?.secrets?.OPENAI_API_KEY ||\r\n    settings.OPENAI_API_KEY\r\n);\r\n```\r\n**Potential Damage**: \r\n- Unauthorized access to API services\r\n- Financial losses through compromised payment APIs\r\n- Data breaches through exposed API keys\r\n- Potential lateral movement in infrastructure\r\n\r\n### 2. Insufficient Error Handling\r\n**Location**: Multiple instances throughout the code\r\n**Impact**: High\r\n**Example**:\r\n```typescript\r\ndb.init()\r\n    .then(() => {\r\n        elizaLogger.success(\"Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database\");\r\n    })\r\n    .catch((error) => {\r\n        elizaLogger.error(\"Failed to connect to PostgreSQL:\", error);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n**Issues**:\r\n- No proper error recovery mechanism\r\n- Continues execution after critical failures\r\n- Incomplete error information logging\r\n- No distinction between different types of database errors\r\n\r\n### 3. Unsafe File Operations\r\n**Location**: `loadCharacters()` function\r\n**Impact**: High\r\n**Vulnerability**:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst content = tryLoadFile(tryPath);\r\nif (content !== null) {\r\n    resolvedPath = tryPath;\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Risks**:\r\n- Directory traversal attacks\r\n- File system access outside intended directories\r\n- Race conditions in file operations\r\n- No file content validation before parsing\r\n\r\n### 4. Insecure Database Initialization\r\n**Location**: `initializeDatabase()` function\r\n**Impact**: High\r\n**Issue**:\r\n```typescript\r\nif (process.env.POSTGRES_URL) {\r\n    const db = new PostgresDatabaseAdapter({\r\n        connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL,\r\n        parseInputs: true,\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Vulnerabilities**:\r\n- No connection pooling\r\n- Unencrypted database URLs in environment\r\n- No SSL/TLS enforcement\r\n- SQL injection risks with parseInputs:true\r\n\r\n### 5. Unvalidated Plugin Loading\r\n**Location**: Character loading and plugin initialization\r\n**Impact**: Critical\r\n**Vulnerability**:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst importedPlugins = await Promise.all(\r\n    character.plugins.map(async (plugin) => {\r\n        const importedPlugin = await import(plugin);\r\n        return importedPlugin.default;\r\n    })\r\n);\r\n```\r\n**Risks**:\r\n- Remote code execution through malicious plugins\r\n- Memory leaks from unmanaged plugin resources\r\n- System compromise through untrusted code execution\r\n- No plugin signature verification\r\n\r\n## Moderate Issues\r\n\r\n### 6. Insufficient Input Validation\r\n**Location**: Throughout client initialization\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n**Example**:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst clientTypes: string[] = character.clients?.map((str) => str.toLowerCase()) || [];\r\n```\r\n**Issues**:\r\n- No validation of client type strings\r\n- Potential prototype pollution\r\n- Missing input sanitization\r\n- Undefined behavior with invalid inputs\r\n\r\n### 7. Inadequate Logging\r\n**Location**: Throughout the codebase\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n**Issue**:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug(`Fetching ${url}`);\r\n```\r\n**Problems**:\r\n- Inconsistent logging levels\r\n- Potential sensitive data exposure in logs\r\n- No log rotation mechanism\r\n- Missing structured logging format\r\n\r\n### 8. Port Security Issues\r\n**Location**: `checkPortAvailable()` and server initialization\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n**Vulnerability**:\r\n```typescript\r\nwhile (!(await checkPortAvailable(serverPort))) {\r\n    serverPort++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Risks**:\r\n- Port scanning vulnerabilities\r\n- Race conditions in port binding\r\n- No maximum port limit\r\n- Potential privilege escalation\r\n\r\n## Minor Issues\r\n\r\n### 9. Memory Management\r\n**Location**: Cache initialization and management\r\n**Impact**: Low\r\n**Issue**: No explicit memory limits or cleanup mechanisms for cache storage\r\n\r\n### 10. Type Safety Issues\r\n**Location**: Throughout the codebase\r\n**Impact**: Low\r\n**Example**: Loose type checking in multiple functions and implicit any types\r\n\r\n## Performance Issues\r\n\r\n### 11. Resource Management\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n- No connection pooling for databases\r\n- Unbounded cache growth potential\r\n- No rate limiting for API calls\r\n- Uncontrolled concurrent operations\r\n\r\n### 12. Scaling Limitations\r\n**Impact**: Moderate\r\n- Single-threaded operation for critical paths\r\n- No horizontal scaling capabilities\r\n- Potential memory leaks in long-running operations\r\n- No backup or failover mechanisms\r\n\r\n## Impact Assessment Matrix\r\n\r\n| Issue | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score |\r\n|-------|------------|--------|------------|\r\n| Secret Management | High | Critical | 10 |\r\n| Error Handling | High | High | 8 |\r\n| File Operations | Medium | High | 7 |\r\n| Database Security | High | High | 8 |\r\n| Plugin Security | Medium | Critical | 9 |\r\n\r\n## Statistics\r\n- Total Critical Issues: 5\r\n- Total High Impact Issues: 3\r\n- Total Moderate Issues: 4\r\n- Total Minor Issues: 2\r\n- Total Performance Issues: 2\r\n\r\nEach issue requires immediate attention based on its risk score and potential impact on system security and stability.",
