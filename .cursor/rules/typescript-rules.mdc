# Typescript Rules

- Dont cast to `any` type when you have a type error, instead think about the underlying issue causing the error and if/how you can update the related code to respect full typesafety.
- If building in React, always use functional react
- Lint all generated code before commiting it
- Double check your code for typescript errors
- Group functionality by file
- Use best practices for project layout
- Please put individual functions in their own file, specify clearly their inputs, outputs, invarients and types. 
- Use functional programing
- When implementing a feature, review your thought process and present to the user a brief step by step explination of your reasoning.
- Before implmenting a feature, collect and review your assumptions about what is nessesary for the feature to work.
