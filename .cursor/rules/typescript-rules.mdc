# Typescript Rules

- Dont cast to `any` type when you have a type error, instead think about the underlying issue causing the error and if/how you can update the related code to respect full typesafety.
- Avoid manual type signatures on functions and vars whenever possible, always prefer to use inference.
- Before declaring new Interfaces, search the codebase and types files to see if there's existing type definitions / zod schemas you can use
